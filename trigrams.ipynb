SECOND EDITION  ILLUSTRATION      LONDON     KEGAN PAUL TRENCH TRBNER  CO. LTD.     MDCCCXCVII         FIRST EDITION PUBLISHED  AS VOL. II. OF BOOKS ABOUT BOOKS.     PREFACE   HAVING VINDICATED IN MY INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER THE PRACTICE OF COLLECTING BOOKPLATES FROM THE CHARGE OF FLAGRANT IMMORALITY I DO NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO SPEND MANY WORDS IN DEMONSTRATING THAT IT IS IN EVERY WAY A WORTHY AND REASONABLE PURSUIT AND ONE WHICH FULLY DESERVES TO BE MADE THE SUBJECT OF A SPECIAL TREATISE IN A SERIES OF BOOKS ABOUT BOOKS. IF NEED WERE THE EDITOR OF THE SERIES WHO ASKED ME TO WRITE THIS LITTLE HANDBOOK WOULD PERHAPS KINDLY ACCEPT HIS SHARE OF RESPONSIBILITY BUT IN THE FACE OF THE EXISTENCE OF A FLOURISHING EX LIBRIS SOCIETY THE IMPORTANCE OF THE BOOKPLATE AS AN OBJECT OF COLLECTION MAY ALMOST BE TAKEN AS AXIOMATIC. MY OWN INTEREST IN THIS PARTICULAR HOBBY IS OF LONG STANDING AND HAPPILY THE APPEARANCE WHEN MY MANUSCRIPT WAS ALREADY AT THE PRINTERS OF MR. EGERTON CASTLES PLEASANTLY WRITTEN AND PROFUSELY ILLUSTRATED WORK ON ENGLISH BOOKPLATES HAS RELIEVED ME OF THE DREADED NECESSITY OF WRITING AN ADDITIONAL CHAPTER ON THOSE MODERN EXAMPLES IN TREATING OF WHICH NEITHER MY KNOWLEDGE NOR MY ENTHUSIASM WOULD HAVE EQUALLED HIS.  THE DESIRE TO POSSESS A BOOKPLATE OF ONES OWN IS IN ITSELF COMMENDABLE ENOUGH FOR IN FIXING THE FIRST COPY INTO THE FIRST BOOK THE OWNER MAY SURELY BE ASSUMED TO HAVE REGISTERED A VOW THAT HE OR SHE AT LEAST WILL NOT JOIN THE GREAT ARMY OF BOOKPERSECUTORSMEN AND WOMEN WHO CANNOT TOUCH A VOLUME WITHOUT MALTREATING IT AND WHO THOUGH THEY ARE OFTEN READY TO DESCRIBE THE REMOVAL OF A BOOKPLATE EVEN FROM A WORTHLESS VOLUME AS AN ACT OF VANDALISM DO INFINITELY MORE HARM TO BOOKS IN GENERAL BY THEIR RUTHLESS HANDLING OF THEM. NO DOUBT ALSO THE DECAY OF INTEREST IN HERALDRY WHICH IS MAINLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ECCENTRICITIES OF MODERN FANCY EXAMPLES HAS TAKEN FROM US THE TEMPTATION TO COMMIT CERTAIN SINS WHICH WERE AT ONE TIME ATTRACTIVE. OUR ANCESTORS FOR INSTANCE MAY SOMETIMES HAVE OUTRAGED THE SUSCEPTIBILITIES OF THE HERALDS BY USING AS BOOKPLATES COATSOFARMS TO WHICH THEY HAD NO TITLE. YET THEIR OFFENCE AGAINST THE COLLEGE OF ARMS WAS TRIVIAL WHEN COMPARED WITH THE OUTRAGE UPON COMMONSENSE COMMITTED BY THE MYSTICAL YOUNG MAN OF TODAY WHO DESIGNS OR HAS DESIGNED FOR HIM AN EMBLEMATIC BOOKPLATE OR A SYMBOLIC BOOKPLATE OR A THEORETIC BOOKPLATE IN WHICH THE EMBLEM OR THE SYMBOL OR THE THEORY IS FAR TOO MYSTICAL FOR ANY ORDINARY COMPREHENSION AND NEEDS IN FACT A LENGTHY EXPLANATION WHICH HOWEVER I AM BOUND TO CONFESS IS ALWAYS VERY WILLINGLY GIVEN BY EITHER OWNER OR DESIGNER IF ASKED FOR.  IT IS PERHAPS NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT I AM VERY FAR FROM INCLUDING ALL MODERN BOOKPLATES UNDER THIS CONDEMNATION. THE NAMES OF THE ARTISTSSIR JOHN MILLAIS MR. STACY MARKS RANDOLPH CALDECOTT MR. WALTER CRANE MISS KATE GREENAWAY AND OTHERSWHO HAVE FOUND TIME TO DESIGN SOME OF THEM ONLY ONE SOME QUITE A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF REALLY INTERESTING MARKS OF OWNERSHIP SUFFICE TO RESCUE MODERN BOOKPLATES FROM ENTIRE DISCREDIT. HERE AND THERE TOO A LITTLEKNOWN ARTIST LIKE THE LATE MR. WINTER OF NORWICH HAS PRODUCED A SINGULARLY FINE PLATE. ABOVE ALL THE STRIKINGLY BEAUTIFUL WORK OF MR. SHERBORN AS SEEN IN THE BOOKPLATES OF THE DUKE OF WESTMINSTER IN THAT OF MR. WILLIAM ROBINSON AND IN MANY OTHER FINE EXAMPLES FORMS A REFRESHING OASIS IN THE DESERT OF WILD ECCENTRICITY. BUT THE MOST ARDENT ADMIRER OF MODERN BOOKPLATES CANNOT PRETEND THAT AMID THE MULTIPLICITY OF RECENT EXAMPLES ANY SCHOOL OR STYLE IS OBSERVABLE AND AS I HAVE AIMED AT GIVING IN THIS LITTLE HANDBOOK AN HISTORIC SKETCH HOWEVER UNPRETENTIOUS OF THE DIFFERENT STYLES ADOPTED IN DESIGNING BOOKPLATES FROM THEIR FIRST INTRODUCTION I HOPE I MAY BE EXCUSED FOR NOT HAVING ATTEMPTED TO TRACE THEIR HISTORY BEYOND THE EARLY YEARS OF THE PRESENT CENTURY AFTER WHICH NO DISTINCTIVE STYLE CAN BE SAID TO EXIST.  AS I HAVE SAID ELSEWHERE IT HAS BEEN NO PART OF MY OBJECT IN WRITING MY BOOK TO ADVOCATE INDISCRIMINATE COLLECTING. BUT FOR THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY COLLECTORS I HAVE ONE WORD OF ADVICE ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ARRANGEMENT OF THEIR TREASURES. SOME ENTHUSIASTS ADVOCATE A CHRONOLOGICAL ARRANGEMENT OTHERS A GENEALOGICAL OTHERS A TOPOGRAPHICAL AND THE ADVOCATES OF EACH THEORY PASTE DOWN THEIR SPECIMENS IN SCRAPBOOKS OR OTHER VOLUMES IN ADHERENCE TO THEIR OWN VIEWS. NOW THERE IS A GREAT DEAL TO BE SAID IN FAVOUR OF EACH OF THESE CLASSIFICATIONS SO MUCH INDEED THAT NO SYSTEM IS PERFECT WHICH DOES NOT ADMIT OF A COLLECTION BEING ARRANGED ACCORDING TO ONE PLAN TODAY AND ANOTHER TOMORROWI.E. NO ARRANGEMENT IS SATISFACTORY WHICH IS NECESSARILY PERMANENT. LET EACH SPECIMEN BE LIGHTLY YET FIRMLY FIXED ON A SEPARATE SHEET OF CARDBOARD OR STOUT PAPER OF SUFFICIENT SIZE TO TAKE THE LARGEST BOOKPLATES COMMONLY MET WITH. THESE CARDS OR SHEETS MAY BE KEPT A HUNDRED OR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TOGETHER IN PORTFOLIOS OR BOXES WHICH SHOULD BE DISTINCTLY NUMBERED. EACH CARD OR SHEET SHOULD ALSO BE PAGED AND BEAR THE NUMBER OF THE PORTFOLIO TO WHICH IT BELONGS. THE COLLECTOR CAN BY THIS MEANS ASCERTAIN WHEN HE PLEASES IF ALL HIS PORTFOLIOS CONTAIN THEIR PROPER NUMBER OF CARDS OR SHEETS AND HE CAN ARRANGE HIS SPECIMENS ACCORDING TO THE PARTICULAR POINT OF INTEREST IN HIS COLLECTION WHICH FROM TIME TO TIME HE MAY DESIRE TO ILLUSTRATE. IN ADDITION TO THIS THE SYSTEM OF SINGLE CARDS HAS OBVIOUS ADVANTAGES FOR THE PURPOSE OF MINUTE STUDY AND COMPARISON.  IN CONCLUSION IT ONLY REMAINS FOR ME TO EXPRESS MY WARM THANKS TO LORD DE TABLEY AND TO MR. A. W. FRANKS C.B. TO THE FORMER FOR ALLOWING ME TO MAKE USE WITHOUT OFTREPEATED ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE MATTER CONTAINED IN HIS GUIDE TO THE STUDY OF BOOKPLATES A SECOND AND MUCH AMPLIFIED EDITION OF WHICH WE MAY HOPE WILL BEFORE LONG MAKE ITS APPEARANCE TO THE LATTER NOT ONLY FOR CONSTANT ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE BUT ALSO FOR THE LOAN FROM HIS COLLECTION OF NEARLY ALL THE BOOKPLATES WITH REPRODUCTIONS OF WHICH THIS VOLUME IS ILLUSTRATED.                                                           W. J. H.     .  ILLUSTRATION     PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION   A FEW WORDS ARE PERHAPS NEEDED BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION TO THE PRESENT REVISED AND ENLARGED EDITION OF THIS WORK. SOME SLIPS OF MY OWN HAVE BEEN RECTIFIED AND THERE HAS BEEN ADDED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BROUGHT TO LIGHT SINCE  FOR MUCH OF THIS I AM INDEBTED TO THE RESEARCHES OF MR. EGERTON CASTLE MR. CHARLES DEXTER ALLEN MISS NORNA LABOUCHERE AND MR. WALTER HAMILTON AS WELL AS TO MR. FINCHAM AND VARIOUS OTHER CONTRIBUTORS TO THE PAGES OF THE EX LIBRIS JOURNAL.  DURING THE THREE YEARS THAT HAVE ELAPSED SINCE THE FIRST PUBLICATION OF MY BOOK THE RANKS OF THOSE TAKING AN INTELLIGENT INTEREST IN BOOKPLATES HAVE BEEN LARGELY INCREASED YET THEY HAVE SUFFERED SOME SERIOUS LOSSES AND FOREMOST AMONGST THESE MUST BE PLACED THE DEATH OF LORD DE TABLEY. THAT HE DIED ERE THE COMPLETION OF THE PROMISED NEW EDITION OF HIS GUIDE TO THE STUDY OF BOOKPLATES IS A MATTER OF SINCERE REGRET TO EVERY STUDENT OF THE SUBJECT ALL WE CAN NOW HOPE FOR IS THAT SIR WOLLASTON FRANKSTHE ONE MAN REALLY CAPABLE OF BRINGING OUT A NEW EDITION OF LORD DE TABLEYS BOOKWILL SOME DAY UNDERTAKE THE TASK.  AS BEFORE I HAVE AGAIN TO EXPRESS MY SINCERE GRATITUDE TO A GREAT NUMBER OF COLLECTORS FOR THE KINDLY HELP THEY HAVE GIVEN ME AND I MUST NOT PASS WITHOUT SPECIAL THANKS THE KINDNESS OF MR. EVERARD GREEN F.S.A. ROUGE DRAGON FOR ALLOWING ME TO ILLUSTRATE THIS PREFACE WITH HIS OWN BOOKPLATE DESIGNED AND ENGRAVED FOR HIM BY MR. GEORGE W. EVE IT IS IN EVERY WAY AN EXCELLENT SPECIMEN OF MODERN WORK IN BOOKPLATES BEING BOTH APPROPRIATE AND ARTISTIC AND ABOVE ALL RATIONAL.                                                           W. J.

ROBERT BLOOMFIELD                                  BOOKPLATES     CHAPTER I  INTRODUCTORY   BOOKPLATE COLLECTING AT LEAST IN THIS COUNTRY IS A THING OF YESTERDAY. ON THE CONTINENT PARTICULARLY IN FRANCE IT ATTRACTED ATTENTION SUFFICIENTLY SERIOUS TO INDUCE THE PUBLICATION IN  OF A MONOGRAPH ON FRENCH BOOKPLATES BY M. POULET MALASSIS WHICH IN THE NEXT YEAR OBTAINED THE HONOURS OF A SECOND EDITION. IN ENGLAND PRIOR TO  WE HAD NO WORK DEVOTED TO THE STUDY BUT IN THAT YEAR THE HONOURABLE J. LEICESTER WARRENAFTERWARDS LORD DE TABLEYPUBLISHED A GUIDE TO THE STUDY OF BOOKPLATES EX LIBRIS. HOW LITTLE WAS THEN GENERALLY KNOWN ABOUT THESE MARKS OF OWNERSHIP IS SHOWN BY THE ALLUSIONS TO THEMVERY FEW IN NUMBERTHAT FIND PLACE IN THE PAGES OF SUCH PUBLICATIONS AS THE GENTLEMANS MAGAZINE OR NOTES AND QUERIES FOR THAT REASON THE SKILFUL HANDLING OF THE SUBJECT BY THE LATE LORD DE TABLEY AND HIS ZEAL IN COMPILING THE TREATISE ARE ALL THE MORE CONSPICUOUS.  ONE OF THE MOST USEFUL WORKS WHICH HAS YET APPEARED IN THE JOURNAL OF THE EX LIBRIS SOCIETYA SOCIETY INTENDED TO PROMOTE THE STUDY OF BOOKPLATESIS A COMPILATION BY MR. H. W. FINCHAM AND MR. J. ROBERTS BROWN A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF BOOKPLATES ARRANGED CHRONOLOGICALLY. A GLANCE AT THIS COMPILATION EMPHASISES THE TRUTH OF THE STATEMENT JUST MADE AS TO THE SCANTINESS OF RECORDED INFORMATION ON BOOKPLATES PRIOR TO THE YEAR  IT ALSO SHOWS WHAT A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THEM HAS BEEN WRITTEN SINCE.  WRITING TO NOTES AND QUERIES IN  DR. JACKSON HOWARD WHOSE COLLECTION IS NOW ONE OF THE LARGEST IN ENGLAND SAYS THAT HE BEGAN COLLECTING FORTY YEARS BEFORE THAT DATE AND THAT THE NUCLEUS OF HIS OWN COLLECTION WAS ONE MADE BY A MISS JENKINS AT BATH IN . IT IS PROBABLY THEREFORE TO THIS LADY THAT WE SHOULD ATTRIBUTE THE HONOUR OF BEING THE FIRST COLLECTOR OF BOOKPLATES FOR THEIR OWN SAKE. NO DOUBT THE COLLECTOR OF ENGRAVINGS ADMITTED INTO HIS PORTFOLIOS BOOKPLATES WORTHY A PLACE THERE AS INTERESTING ENGRAVINGS FOR STRAY EXAMPLES ARE OFTEN FOUND IN SUCH COLLECTIONS AS THAT FORMED IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY BY JOHN BAGFORD THE BIBLIOCLAST WHICH IS NOW IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM. NO DOUBT TOO HERALDIC PAINTERS OR PLATE ENGRAVERS COLLECTED BOOKPLATES AS SPECIMENS OF HERALDRY BUT THIS WAS NOT COLLECTING THEM AS BOOKPLATESVIZ. AS ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE CUSTOM OF PLACING MARKS OF OWNERSHIP IN BOOKS WHICH I TAKE IT WAS EVIDENTLY MISS JENKINSS OBJECT.  STILL THOUGH LITTLE WAS WRITTEN ON THE SUBJECT OF BOOKPLATES PRIOR TO  IT BY NO MEANS FOLLOWS THAT FOR SOME YEARS BEFORE THAT DATE THERE HAD NOT BEEN A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF PERSONS WHO TOOK AN INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT. THE FACT IS THAT THE BOOKPLATE COLLECTOR OF EARLIER DAYS WAS WISER IN HIS GENERATION THAN ARE THOSE OF HIS KIND TODAY. HE KEPT HIS HOBBY TO HIMSELF AND WAS THUS ENABLED TO INDULGE IT ECONOMICALLY. MY FATHER HAD A SMALL COLLECTION AND I CAN WELL REMEMBER HOW AS A BOY I USED TO HELP HIM TO ADD TO IT. WE USED TO GO TO A SHOP IN A DINGY STREET LEADING OFF OXFORD STREET AND THERE SELECT FROM A LARGE CLOTHESBASKET AS MANY BOOKPLATES AS WERE NEW TO OUR COLLECTION. THE PRICE WAS ONE PENNY A PIECENEW OR OLD DATED OR UNDATED ENGLISH OR FOREIGN THAT OF BISHOP BURNET OR DAVID GARRICK OR MR. JONES OR MR. BROWNALL ALIKE A PENNY A PIECE AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THOUGH I DO NOT REMEMBER THE FACT THERE WAS THE USUAL REDUCTION ON TAKING A QUANTITY. I THINK THIS SHOP WAS ALMOST THE ONLY ONE IN LONDON WHERE YOU COULD BUY BOOKPLATES AT ALL. WELL THOSE DAYS ARE PAST NOW AND WHILST WE REGRET THEM BECAUSE BOOKPLATE COLLECTING IS NO LONGER AN ECONOMICAL PURSUIT WE CANNOT ALLOW OUR REGRET TO BE UNMINGLED WITH SATISFACTION. THE WOULDBE COLLECTOR OF TODAY CAN IF HE PLEASES KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE COLLECTION HE IS UNDERTAKING HE CAN TELL WHEN HE MEETS WITH A GOOD SPECIMEN HE KNOWS THE POINTS WHICH RENDER ANY PARTICULAR BOOKPLATE INTERESTING AND HE CAN AT LEAST APPROXIMATELY AFFIX A DATE TO EACH EXAMPLE HE OBTAINS.  AS TO THE MORALITY OF BOOKPLATE COLLECTING I SUPPOSE SOMETHING OUGHT TO BE SAID HERE. THERE IS BUT ONE OBJECTION TO IT BUT THAT IS UNDOUBTEDLY A SERIOUS ONE TAKING A BOOKPLATE OUT OF A BOOK MEANS THE POSSIBLE DISFIGUREMENT AND INJURY OF THE VOLUME FROM WHICH IT IS TAKEN YET FOR THE PURPOSE OF STUDY AND COMPARISON THE REMOVAL IS A DISTINCT ADVANTAGE. TO CONFESS THIS SEEMS AT FIRST SIGHT TO BRING COLLECTING AT ALL UNDER A SWEEPING CONDEMNATION AND SUCH INDEED WOULD BE THE CASE WERE IT NOT FOR THE FACT THAT DAMAGE TO OR EVEN THE ACTUAL DESTRUCTION OF VERY MANY BOOKS IS REALLY A MATTER OF NO CONSEQUENCE WHATEVER. BOOKPLATES ARE FOUND QUITE AS OFTEN IN THE WORTHLESS LITERARY PRODUCTIONS OF OUR ANCESTORS AS IN THE WORTHY AND IT IS PUERILE TO CAVIL OVER THE REMOVAL OF A BOOKPLATE FROM A BINDING WHICH HOLDS TOGETHER MATERIAL BY THE DESTRUCTION OF WHICH THE WORLD WOULD CERTAINLY NOT BE THE POORER. SO MUCH FOR THE BOOKPLATES IN VALUELESS BOOKS. AS REGARDS THOSE IN VALUABLE OR INTERESTING ONES IT IS CERTAINLY UNWISE TO REMOVE THEM AT ALL. THIS IS A GOLDEN RULE WHICH CANNOT BE TOO FORCIBLY IMPRESSED UPON COLLECTORS AND BOOKSELLERS. THE CASE DOES NOT OCCUR VERY OFTEN AND WHEN IT DOES THE BOOK ITSELF WITH THE BOOKPLATE IN IT CAN BE EASILY FETCHED AND PLACED BESIDE THE COLLECTION WHEN NEEDED FOR COMPARISON. IT MAY HAPPEN THAT THE BOOKPLATE IN THIS VALUABLE BOOK IS INTERESTING FROM THE FACT THAT IT BELONGED TO SOME MAN OF NOTE OR THAT IT IS UNIQUE IF SO WE HAVE ONLY A FURTHER REASON AGAINST TAKING IT OUT OF THE VOLUME. THE VALUE OF A VERY EARLY BOOKPLATE WHEN PRESERVED IN THE VOLUME IN WHICH IT IS DISCOVERED IS LESSENED ALMOST TO A VANISHING POINT IF SEPARATED FROM THAT VOLUME. PASTED INTO A BOOK AS A MARK OF OWNERSHIP IT IS AN UNDOUBTED BOOKPLATE WHEREAS IF TAKEN OUT AND FASTENED INTO A COLLECTION OF BOOKPLATES IT AT ONCE LOSES THE PROOF OF ITS ORIGINAL USE SO ESSENTIAL TO ITS VALUE AND SO MATERIAL TO THE STUDENT OF BOOKPLATES.  ON THE OTHER HAND AS I HAVE SAID THERE IS NO HARM IN REMOVING FROM SOME UNINTERESTING AND VALUELESS VOLUME THE BOOKPLATE OF A FAMOUS MAN. EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT BISHOP BURNET OR DAVID GARRICK HAD PLENTY OF WHAT THEY THEMSELVES REGARDED AS RUBBISH IN THEIR LIBRARIES SO THAT BURNETS BOOKPLATE IN AN ACTUALLY VALUELESS VOLUME DOES NOT PROVE THAT THE BISHOPS SHREWD EYE EVER SCANNED ITS PAGES OR THAT HIS EPISCOPAL HAND EVER HELD IT. BESIDES I KNOW AS A FACT THAT IT IS A NOT UNCOMMON TRICK FOR THE POSSESSOR OF THE BOOKPLATE OF SOME FAMOUS MAN TO AFFIX THAT BOOKPLATE IN A WORTHLESS VOLUME AND THEN OFFER THE WHOLE FOR SALE AT A PRICE MUCH HIGHER THAN WOULD BE ASKED OR OBTAINED FOR THE BOOKPLATE ITSELF THOUGH THE VALUE OF THE BOOK MAY BE NIL  WITHOUT QUARRELLING WITH THE NAME BOOKPLATEAS APPLIED TO THE MARKS OF OWNERSHIP PASTED INTO BOOKSAND WITHOUT WASTING TIME WITH DISCUSSION OF SUGGESTIONS FOR A BETTER ONE IT MAY BE ADMITTED THAT THE WORD IS NOT ALTOGETHER HAPPILY CHOSEN. IT PERHAPS SUGGESTS TO THE MIND OF THE UNINITIATED AN ILLUSTRATION IN A BOOK RATHER THAN A MARK OF POSSESSION. BUT THEN AT THE PRESENT DAY THERE ARE NOT MANY UNINITIATED AMONGST EITHER BUYERS OR SELLERS OF BOOKS AND PRINTS SO THAT THE INAPPROPRIATENESS OF THE NAME NEED NOT CONCERN US.  AS TO ITS ANTIQUITY THAT IS DOUBTFUL BUT PROBABLY ONE OF THE EARLIEST INSTANCES OF ITS USE IN PRINT OCCURS IN  WHEN JOHN IRELAND PUBLISHED THE FIRST TWO VOLUMES OF HIS HOGARTH ILLUSTRATED. IN THIS WORK HE SAYS THAT THE WORKS OF CALLOT WERE PROBABLY HOGARTHS FIRST MODELS AND SHOP BILLS AND BOOKPLATES HIS FIRST PERFORMANCES. AGAIN IN  IRELAND REFERS TO THE BOOKPLATE FOR LAMBERT THE HERALDPAINTER WHICH HOGARTH HAD EXECUTED. IN  A CERTAIN C. S. B. WRITING IN THE PAGES OF THE GENTLEMANS MAGAZINE REFERS TO WHAT ARE GENERALLY CALLED BOOKPLATES. HIS LETTER WAS SUGGESTED BY AN ARTICLEA REVIEW OF THOMAS MOULES BIBLIOTHECA HERALDICAIN THE PREVIOUS NUMBER OF THE MAGAZINE THE WRITER OF WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE TERM BOOKPLATE AS WE NOW APPLY IT FOR HE CALLS BOOKPLATES PLATES OF ARMS. WE SHALL SEE LATER ON THAT THIS IS QUITE AN INAPPROPRIATE NAME SOME OF THE MOST INTERESTING AND THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BOOKPLATES HAVE NOTHING ARMORIAL ABOUT THEM.  ON THE CONTINENT THE TERM EX LIBRIS IS GENERALLY APPLIED TO BOOKPLATES. THIS IS PERHAPS EVEN LESS APPROPRIATE THAN BOOKPLATE. IT IS TAKEN FROM THE TWO FIRST WORDS OF THE INSCRIPTION ON A GREAT MANY BOOKPLATES WHEN THE INSCRIPTION IS WRITTEN IN LATINE.G. EX LIBRIS JOHANNIS STEARNE S.T.P. EPISCOPI CLOGHERENSIS. A MOMENTS REFLECTION WILL SHOW THAT THIS INSCRIPTION IS NOT INTENDED AS A DECLARATION BY THE BOOKPLATE SHOULD IT EVER BECOME SEVERED FROM THE BOOK IN WHICH IT WAS FASTENED THAT IT CAME OUT OF A BOOK BELONGING TO BISHOP STEARNE BUT THAT IT IS A DECLARATION BY THE BOOK IN WHICH THE BOOKPLATE IS FOUND PASTED THAT THAT PARTICULAR BOOK IS FROM AMONGST THE BOOKS OF A PARTICULAR LIBRARY AND OUGHT TO BE RESTORED TO IT. IT WOULD BE AS RATIONAL TO CALL BOOKPLATES LIBRI BECAUSE THE INSCRIPTION ON THEM OFTEN BEGINSAS IN A VERY FAMOUS GERMAN BOOKPLATELIBER BILIBALDI PIRCKHEIMER. IT MAY INDEED BE LAID DOWN AS A GENERAL RULE THAT WHATEVER THE SENTIMENT EXPRESSED ON A BOOKPLATE IT IS CLEARLY INTENDED TO BE UTTERED BY THE BOOK IN WHICH THE BOOKPLATE IS FIXED NOT BY THE BOOKPLATE ITSELF.  THERE ARE BUT TWO INSTANCES QUOTED BY LORD DE TABLEY OF THE INSCRIPTION DIRECTLY REFERRING TO THE BOOKPLATE. BOTH ARE FOREIGN AND DATE ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY. ONE IS SYMBOLUM BIBLIOTHEC OF JOHN BERNARD NACK A CITIZEN AND MERCHANT OF FRANKFORT AND THE OTHER INSIGNE LIBRORUM ETC. QUOTED FROM THE WORK OF M. POULET MALASSIS. LORD DE TABLEY THINKS THAT THE SYMBOLUM OF HERR NACK IS SIMPLY A TRADE CARD BUT HE FOUNDS THIS CONCLUSION ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT HERR NACK WAS A BOOKDEALER AND THAT THE SCENE DEPICTED ON HIS BOOKPLATE WAS IN FACT HIS SHOP. IN MY OPINION WE HAVE IN THIS BOOKPLATE A REPRESENTATION OF A PORTION OF HERR NACKS LIBRARY IN WHICH MINERVA IS SEATED USING THE BOOKS THEREOF. A GENTLEMAN IN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY DRESS WHO MAY LIKELY ENOUGH BE HERR NACK HIMSELF ADDRESSES HIMSELF TO THE GODDESS AND EXPLAINSAS HE POINTS TO THE OUTER SCENE WHICH SHOWS US SHIPS AND MERCHANDISETHAT WHILST FOLLOWING HIS TRADE AS A MERCHANT HE STILL HAS TIME TO DEVOTE SOME ATTENTION TO LITERATURE. IN ANY CASE THESE AND THE FEW OTHER INSTANCES THERE MAY BE OF THE INSCRIPTION REFERRING TO THE BOOKPLATE AND NOT TO THE BOOK SEEM HARDLY SUFFICIENT TO MAKE EX LIBRIS A GOOD NAME FOR BOOKPLATES IN GENERAL.  OUR ANCESTORS OF DEGREES MORE REMOTE THAN GRANDFATHER DO NOT APPEAR TO HAVE REFERRED TO BOOKPLATES AT ALL SO WE ARE UNABLE TO LEARN BY WHAT NAME THEY WOULD HAVE CALLED THEM. PEPYS IN  SPEAKS OF GOING TO HIS PLATEMAKERS AND THERE SPENDING AN HOUR ABOUT CONTRIVING HIS LITTLE PLATE FOR HIS BOOKS. THIS LITTLE PLATE STILL EXISTS AND IS A CHARACTERISTIC ONE IT SHOWS US THE INITIALS S. P. WITH TWO ANCHORS AND ROPES ENTWINED. BUT WE SHALL SPEAK AGAIN OF THIS AND SAMS OTHER BOOKPLATES LATER ON.  ILLUSTRATION SIR THOMAS ISHAMS BOOKPLATE BY DAVID LOGGAN.  DAVID LOGGAN A GERMAN BORN AND AN ENGRAVER OF SOME NOTE HAS IN WRITING TO SIR THOMAS ISHAM IN  A NO MORE CONCISE NAME FOR ISHAMS BOOKPLATE THAN A PRINT OF YOUR COTE OF ARMS. LOGGAN AS A RETURN FOR MANY FAVOURS HAD SENT SIR THOMAS A BOOKPLATE DESIGNED AND EXECUTED BY HIMSELF. SIR HE SAYS IN THE COVERING LETTER I SEND YOU HIER A PRINT OF YOUR COTE OF ARMES. I HAVE PRINTED  WICH I WILL SEND WITH THE PLATE BY THE NEXT RETURN AND BEGE THE FAVOR OF YOUR KEIND EXCEPTTANS OF IT AS A SMALL NIEW YAERS GIFT OR A AKNOWLEDGMENT IN PART FOR ALL YOUR FAVORS. IF ANYTHING IN IT BE AMIES I SHALL BE GLADE TO MEND IT. I HAVE TAKEN THE HERALDS PAINTERS DERECTION IN IT IT IS VERY MUCH USED AMONGST PERSONS OF QUALITY TO PAST THER COTES OF ARMES BEFOR THER BOOKES INSTADE OF WREITHING THER NAMES.  THE HERALDS PAINTER WAS UNFORTUNATELY WRONG IN HIS TREATMENT OF THE ISHAM COAT AND SO LOGGANS WORK ARTISTIC AS IT MIGHT BE COULD NOT BE ACCEPTABLE TO SIR THOMAS TO WHOM A MISTAKE IN THE FAMILY ESCUTCHEON WAS NO LIGHT MATTER. THIS HE EVIDENTLY TOLD DAVID WHO A FEW DAYS AFTER WRITES TO HIM AGAIN  I AME SORRY THAT THE COTE IS WRONGE I HAVE TAKEN THE HERALDS DERECTION IN IT BUT THE FOOLE DID GIVE IT WRONG. . . . THE ALTERING OF THE PLATE WILL BE VERY TRUBELSOM AND THERFOR YOU WILL BE PRESENTED WITH A NEWE ONE WICH SHALL BE DON WITHOUT FALT AND THAT VERY SUDENLY. AND IF YOU PLASE SIR TO GIVE THIES PLATE AND THE PRINTS TO YOUR BROTHERS IT WILL SERVE FOR THEM.  THESE ISHAM BOOKPLATES ARE REALLY VERY BEAUTIFUL PIECES OF WORK. A REPRODUCTION OF ONE OF THEM MAY BE SEEN ON THE FOREGOING PAGE. THIS IS EVIDENTLY THE ONE FIRST EXECUTED THE OMISSION OF THE MARK OF BARONETCYTHE BLOODY HAND OF ULSTERAND THE HELMET OF AN ESQUIRE INSTEAD OF A KNIGHT OR BARONET CLEARLY CONSTITUTING THE BLUNDER INTO WHICH LOGGAN HAD FALLEN. BY THE KINDNESS OF SIR CHARLES ISHAM THE PRESENT BARONET I HAVE BEEN ENABLED TO SEE A COPY OF THE CORRECTED DESIGN SENT BY LOGGAN WHICH IS IN ALL RESPECTS ACCURATE. THIS WAS DOING DUTY AS A BOOKPLATE IN A VOLUME IN WHICH IT HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN PLACED AT THE TIME IT WAS RECEIVED BY SIR THOMAS.  NICHOLAS CAREW AFTERWARDS SIR NICHOLAS CAREW BARONET RECORDS IN HIS ACCOUNTS ON THE TH FEBRUARY  A PAYMENT FOR HIS BOOKPLATE WHICH IS DATED IN THAT YEAR AS FOLLOWSFOR COAT OF ARMS IMPRESSING L. S. D. AND A FEW MONTHS LATER IS A PAYMENT FOR  ARMES S. D.  THE MARK OF MY BOOKS IS THE PHRASE WHICH ANDREW LUMISDEN APPLIES TO THE BOOKPLATE ENGRAVED FOR HIM BY HIS BROTHERINLAW SIR ROBERT STRANGE ABOUT THE YEAR . THE PLATE IS AN INTERESTING ONE AND BY AN INTERESTING MAN OF WHOM WE SHALL SPEAK LATER ON. LUMISDEN THOUGHT WELL OF IT AND THUS REFERS TO THE WORK IN A LETTER WRITTEN FROM ROUEN IN JUNE I AM VERY ANXIOUS TO KNOW IF MY BROTHER CONTINUES HIS RESOLUTION OF COMING TO THIS COUNTRY. IF HE DOES I CAN LUCKILY BE OF USE TO HIM IN THE WAY OF HIS BUSINESS FROM THE ACQUAINTANCE I HAVE OF A VERY INGENIOUS PERSON PROFESSOR OF THE ACADEMY OF DESIGN HERE . . . I SHOWD HIM A FEW DAYS AGO THE MARK OF MY BOOKS FROM WHICH HE ENTERTAINS A HIGH NOTION OF ROBIES ABILITIES.  THERE IS A CURIOUS ADVERTISEMENT QUOTED BY THOMAS MOULE IN HIS BIBLIOTHECA HERALDICA OF A CERTAIN JOSEPH BARBER A NEWCASTLEONTYNE BOOKSELLER MUSIC AND COPPERPLATE PUBLISHER WHO IN  RESIDED IN HUMBLES BUILDINGS. IN THAT YEAR HE ENGRAVED THE EQUESTRIAN STATUE OF KING JAMES II. WHICH ONCE STOOD IN THE SANDHILL MARKET. IF A MOMENTS DIGRESSION BE ALLOWED THE HISTORY OF THIS STATUE IS WORTH TELLING. ON TH MARCH  THE TOWN COUNCIL VOTED  FOR THE ERECTION OF A FIGURE OF HIS MAJESTY IN A ROMAN HABIT ON A CAPERING HORSE IN COPPER AS BIG AS THE FIGURE OF HIS MAJESTY KING CHARLES I. AT CHARING CROSSE ON A PEDESTAL OF BLACK MARBLE. A CERTAIN MR. WILLIAM LARSON EXECUTED IT SIR CHRISTOPHER WREN EXPRESSED HIS APPROVAL AND EVERYBODY WAS VERY PLEASED FOR A YEAR OR TWO. BUT POPULAR FEELING SOON CHANGED IN NEWCASTLE AS ELSEWHERE AND THE PREVALENCE OF SENTIMENTS WHICH THREW THE KING OFF HIS THRONE THREW HIS METAL REPRESENTATION INTO THE TYNE WHERE IT RESTED TILL FISHED OUT TO BE MELTED DOWN AND USED TO MAKE A SET OF CHURCH BELLS. THE DRAWING OF THE LUCKLESS STATUE WAS SAFE IN THE KEEPING OF SIR HANS SLOANE AND FROM THIS BARBER MADE HIS ENGRAVING WHICH HE SOLD FOR S. THE FACT THAT IN  THREE YEARS BEFORE THE SECOND SCOTCH REBELLION THIS NEWCASTLE PRINTSELLER FOUND IT WORTH WHILE TO ISSUE THE ENGRAVING AT ALL IS NOT WITHOUT POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE. WITH HIS ENGRAVING BARBER ISSUED TWO LARGE PLATES OF THE ARMS OF ALL THE SUBSCRIBERS TO IT EACH COAT OF ARMS BEING  INCHES IN LENGTH AND  INCHES IN BREADTH AND A FEW YEARS LATER IT SEEMS TO HAVE OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE MIGHT TURN AN HONEST PENNY BY CUTTING UP THESE LARGE SHEETS OF THE SUBSCRIBERS ARMS SO THAT EACH COAT OF ARMS BECAME A SEPARATE PLATE. HAVING DONE THIS HE ISSUED AN ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SUBSCRIBERS IN WHICH HE SETS FORTH THAT HE IS THE SOLE PROPRIETOR OF EACH OF THEIR PLATES AND IS WILLING TO PART WITH IT TO THE LADY OR GENTLEMAN WHOSE ARMS ARE ENGRAVED THEREON TOGETHER WITH ONE HUNDRED PRINTS OF IT ON A GOOD PAPER FOR THE MODEST SUM OF HALFACROWN. THESE PLATES SUGGESTS MR. BARBER MIGHT BE ADVANTAGEOUSLY USED AS WHAT WE NOW CALL BOOKPLATES AND HE CONTINUES THE DESIGN OF THIS PROPOSAL IS A USEFUL AND NECESSARY EMBELLISHMENT AND A REMEDY AGAINST LOSING BOOKS BY LENDING OR HAVING THEM STOLEN BY PASTING ONE PRINT ON THE INSIDE OF THE COVER OF EACH BOOK YOU HAVE THE OWNERS NAME COAT OF ARMS AND PLACE OF ABODE A THING SO USEFUL AND THE CHARGE SO EASY TIS HOPED WILL MEET WITH ENCOURAGEMENT. TO HAVE A PLATE ENGRAVED WILL COST S. D.  FROM ALL WHICH IT MAY BE INFERRED THAT MR. JOSEPH BARBER THOUGHTOR WANTED OTHER PEOPLE TO THINKTHAT THE IDEA OF USING A BOOKPLATE WAS HIS OWN. NEWCASTLE PEOPLE IN  MUST HAVE BEEN VERY UNOBSERVANT OF THE HABITS OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS IF THEY BELIEVED MR. BARBER FOR THE FASHION OF USING A BOOKPLATEWHICH IN ENGLAND CAME IN SOME FORTY YEARS BEFOREWAS BY THAT TIME GENERAL THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. THAT SOME OF THE SUBSCRIBERS ACCEPTED THE OFFER AND GOT THEIR HUNDRED PLATES ON A GOOD PAPER FOR HALFACROWN IS DEMONSTRATED BY THE EXISTENCE OF COPIES OF THE PLATES PUBLISHED WITH THE EQUESTRIAN STATUE BEING STILL FOUND IN BOOKS DOING DUTY AS BOOKPLATES. VERY POOR PRODUCTIONS THEY ARE REFLECTING BUT SLIGHT CREDIT ON THE DESIGNER OR ENGRAVER. BUT WHAT JOSEPH LACKED IN ART HE ATONED FOR IN ENTERPRISE WE SEE THIS IN HIS INGENIOUS WAY OF GETTING RID OF HIS OLD COPPERPLATES AND THE POSTSCRIPT TO HIS ADVERTISEMENT DEMONSTRATES THE FACT EVEN MORE PLAINLY FOR ON A DAY NEAR AT HAND THE ADVERTISEMENT TELLS US WAS TO BE FOUGHT AT A NEIGHBOURING COCKPIT A WELSH MAIN AND THE PRIZE WAS TO BE NOTHING LESS THAN ONE OF THE ADVERTISERS ENGRAVINGS A PRETTY PIECE OF WORK WORTHY THE OBSERVATION OF THE CURIOUS. IF THE TERM BOOKPLATE HAD BEEN KNOWN IN BARBERS DAY IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE FOUND ITS WAY INTO HIS ADVERTISEMENT WHICH IS CLUMSY FROM THE WANT OF A WORD TO EXPRESS THE VERY THING HE IS ADVERTISING.  WILLIAM STEPHENS WHO ENGRAVED A GOOD MANY BOOKPLATES IN HIS TIME COULD FIND NO BETTER EXPRESSION THAN PRINT OF YOUR ARMS TO DESCRIBE THE  BOOKPLATES WHICH FOR HALFAGUINEA HE SENT TO DR. SAMUEL KERRICH THE SHAKESPEARIAN STUDENT IN .  HORACE WALPOLE AGAIN WOULD I THINK HAVE USED THE PHRASE BOOKPLATE HAD HE KNOWN IT. IN HIS CATALOGUE OF ENGRAVERSTHE EDITION OF HE SPEAKS OF GEORGE VERTUE HAVING ENGRAVED A PLATE TO PUT IN LADY OXFORDS BOOKS AND IN HIS ANECDOTES OF PAINTING HE REFERS TO THE PLATE WHICH HOGARTH USED FOR HIS BOOKS. ONE OF HIS OWN BOOKPLATESTHAT ENGRAVED SOON AFTER WALPOLE DESCRIBES AS HIS SEAL SIGILLUM HORATII COMITIS DE ORFORD BUT THIS PHRASE IS I THINK USED SIMPLY BECAUSE THE BOOKPLATE ITSELF IS THE REPRESENTATION OF A MEDIVAL SEAL. BARTOLOZZIGIVING IN  A RECEIPT FOR A BOOKPLATE WHICH HE HAD JUST COMPLETEDREFERS TO IT AS A TICKETPLATE SEE P.  BUT HE WAS A FOREIGNER AND MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN THE ENGLISH NAME FOR SUCH THINGS FOR WE HAVE SEEN THAT SOME FIVE YEARS BEFORE IRELAND REFERS TO HOGARTHS BOOKPLATE. CHARLES JAMES FOX IN A NOTE DATED AT LEICESTER ON ND AUGUST  SPEAKS OF THE BOOKPLATE OF HIS GREATGREATGRANDFATHER SIR STEPHEN FOX.  BUT THOUGH THE PHRASE BOOKPLATE MAY HAVE BEEN OCCASIONALLY USED AT THE CLOSE OF THE LAST CENTURY AND THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESENT IT WAS THEN BY NO MEANS WIDELY USED AND ALTHOUGH THE WRITER QUOTED ON PAGE  REFERS IN  TO WHAT ARE GENERALLY CALLED BOOKPLATES WILLIAM WADD IN  CAN FIND NO DIRECT TERM BY WHICH TO REFER TO THESE MARKS OF OWNERSHIP. SPEAKING IN MEMS. MAXIMS AND MEMOIRS HE SAYS IN THE LIBRARY OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS THERE ARE MANY VOLUMES FORMERLY THE PROPERTY OF THE CELEBRATED DOUGLAS HAVING HIS ARMS EMBELLISHED WITH VARIOUS KINDS OF SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS WHICH WAS BY NO MEANS AN UNCOMMON PRACTICE AS IN THE LIBRARY OF THE COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES OF VOLUMES WHERE THE FORMER POSSESSOR HAS NOT ONLY BLAZONED HIS OWN ARMS BUT BORROWED THE ARMS OF THE COLLEGE AND SUPERADDED SUPPORTERS AS APOLLO MERCURY SCULAPIUS AND HIS DAUGHTER HYGEIA.  LORD BYRON TOO DID NOT I FANCY KNOW THE WORD BOOKPLATE IN ITS NOWUSED SENSE WRITING TO A FAIR ADMIRER WHO HAD APPARENTLY DESIGNED ONE OF THESE FOR HIM HE SAYS I RECEIVED THE ARMS MY DEAR MISS  AND AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR THE TROUBLE YOU HAVE TAKEN. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE I SHOULD HAVE ANY FAULT TO FIND WITH THEM. THE SIGHT OF THE DRAWING GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE FOR A DOUBLE REASON IN THE FIRST PLACE THEY WILL ORNAMENT MY BOOKS AND IN THE NEXT THEY CONVINCE ME THAT YOU HAVE NOT ENTIRELY FORGOT ME.  SO THE TERM BOOKPLATE IS ONLY A CENTURY OLD AND THE FASHION OF COLLECTING BOOKPLATES MUCH MORE MODERN STILL BUT THE USE OF BOOKPLATES IS REALLY OF RESPECTABLE ANTIQUITY AND IS A MATTER ON WHICH WE MAY NOW APPROPRIATELY SPEAK. WHETHER IN THE FIRST INSTANCE THE USE OF BOOKPLATES WAS SUGGESTED BY A DESIRE TO COMMEMORATE A GIFT OR AS A MARK OF OWNERSHIP SEEMS TO BE A MATTER ON WHICH A VARIETY OF OPINIONS EXIST. SOME OF THE EARLIEST MECHANICALLY PRODUCED BOOKPLATES ARE CERTAINLY COMMEMORATIVE OF GIFTS SEE P.  BUT I THINK WE MUST ACCEPT AS BOOKPLATES TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES THE SIX FOURTEENTH CENTURY EXAMPLES MENTIONED BY HERR WARNECKE IN HIS DIE DEUTSCHEN BCHERZEICHEN AN EXCELLENT WORK ON GERMAN BOOKPLATES. THESE ARE HERALDIC COLOURED DRAWINGS ON THE PARCHMENT LEAVES OF ITALIAN MANUSCRIPTS WHICH ALSO BEAR AN INSCRIPTION OF POSSESSION BY THE PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS WHOSE ARMS ARE REPRESENTED.  BUT OF COURSE THE REAL NECESSITY FOR BOOKPLATES WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN THEIR ORIGINAL USE BEGAN WHEN THE PRINTINGPRESS GAVE TO THE WORLD NOT TWO NOR THREE BUT A HUNDRED OR MORE COPIES OF A PARTICULAR BOOK. THEN IT WAS THAT THE DIFFERENT OWNERS NEEDED TO DISTINGUISH THEIR RESPECTIVE COPIES OF A WORK FOR THE PROFESSIONAL BOOKBORROWER WHO WOULD GLADLY HAVE RETAINED THE MANUSCRIPT VOLUME LENT TO HIM BY AN UNSUSPECTING FRIEND COULD HE HAVE DONE SO WITHOUT HIS CRIME BEING DETECTED DOUBTLESS SAW IN THE MULTITUDE OF COPIES A GREATER OPPORTUNITY OF CARRYING OUT HIS NEFARIOUS DESIGNS. THE EXISTENCE OF BOOKPLATES IS THEREFORE LARGELY DUE TO THE LITERARY ENTHUSIAST WHO AMASSES A LIBRARY BY RETAINING VOLUMES RECEIVED ON LOAN THE INSCRIPTIONS ON SOME OF THE EARLIER BOOKPLATES PROVE THIS TO BE SO.  THE EARLIEST PRINTED BOOKPLATES ARE CERTAINLY GERMAN AND THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THAT SOME OF THESE ARE NEARLY CONTEMPORARY WITH THE VERY EARLY PRINTED BOOKS ON THE OAK COVERS OF WHICH THEY MAY STILL BE FOUND PASTED. BY THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY BOOKPLATES WERE FREQUENTLY FINE EXAMPLES OF THE WOODENGRAVERS ART. ALBERT DRER HIMSELF DESIGNED BOOKPLATES AND OF THESE ONE OF THE MOST ELABORATE AND THE BEST KNOWN IS THAT OF HIS FRIEND BILIBALD PIRCKHEIMER THE NUREMBERG JURIST WHOSE PORTRAIT HE ENGRAVED ON COPPER IN . THE BOOKPLATE IS STILL EARLIER.  ENGLAND CAN NOWTHANKS TO RECENT INVESTIGATIONSCLAIM THE SECOND PLACE IN THE CHRONOLOGICAL SEQUENCE OF COUNTRIES IN WHICH BOOKPLATES HAVE BEEN USED. CARDINAL WOLSEYS BOOKPLATE SEE P.  IS PROBABLY NOT LATER IN DATE THAN . FRANCE CAN BOAST OF A BOOKPLATE DATED IN  SWEDEN OF ONE DATED IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND SWITZERLAND OF ONE IN  ITALY IN  IN OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES DATED EXAMPLES DO NOT APPEAR NOR DOES THE PRACTICE OF USING BOOKPLATES SEEM TO HAVE BEEN ADOPTED UNTIL CONSIDERABLY LATER.  IN CONCLUDING THIS OPENING CHAPTER LET ME SAY A WORD ABOUT THE POSITION IN A BOOK IN WHICH A BOOKPLATE SHOULD BE LOOKED FOR. THE USUAL PLACE WAS CERTAINLY ON THE FRONT COVER OF A VOLUME SOMETIMES ANOTHER COPY OF THE SAME PLATE WAS FASTENED TO THE BACK COVER AND SOMETIMESAS IN PIRCKHEIMERS CASE JUST NOTICED AND IN THAT OF SAMUEL PEPYS SEE P. THE SAME PERSON WOULD USE A DIFFERENT BOOKPLATE AT THE BACK OF THE VOLUME TO THAT USED AT THE FRONT. ANOTHER PLAN LESS FREQUENT BUT BY NO MEANS UNCOMMON WAS TO INSERT THE BOOKPLATE ON THE TITLEPAGE OFTEN ON THE BACK OF IT AND ANOTHER TO FASTEN THE BOOKPLATE INTO THE VOLUME BY PASTING ITS RIGHTHAND MARGIN ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN INCH ON TO THE TITLEPAGE SO THAT THE BOOKPLATE WOULD FOLD OVER AND FACE IT. THIS IS A PLAN THAT LEADS TO A BOOKPLATE BEING MOST EASILY OVERLOOKED.  COLLECTORS SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT IN MANY INSTANCES BOOKPLATES ARE FOUND IN A VARIETY OF SIZES THIS SHOULD CERTAINLY BE BORNE IN MIND WHEN SETTING ASIDE ANY PARTICULAR SPECIMEN AS A DUPLICATE. IN THE PRESENT DAY MOST PEOPLE ARE CONTENT TO HAVE A BOOKPLATE SMALL ENOUGH TO GO INTO A VOLUME OF ANY SIZE ITS DWARFED APPEARANCE ON THE COVER OF A FULLSIZED FOLIO IS NO EYESORE TO THEM OR IF IT IS THE PLEASURE OF ECONOMY MAKES THEM BEAR WITH IT. BUT IN DAYS GONE BY IT WASESPECIALLY IN GERMANYCERTAINLY OTHERWISE. THE POSSESSION OF A LARGE LIBRARY WOULD NECESSITATE IN THE OWNERS MIND THE POSSESSION OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENTLY SIZED BOOKPLATES IN ORDER TO GET ONE WHICH WOULD NEITHER LOOK TOO SMALL IN THE LARGEST VOLUME NOR BE TOO LARGE FOR THE SMALLEST SOME OF THE MOST NOBLE FOREIGN EXAMPLES RICH IN DETAIL AND BOLD IN GENERAL EFFECT ARE THOSE THAT BELONGED TO MEN WHO LIKED TO HAVE FOR THEIR FOLIOS A BOOKPLATE OF PROPORTIONATE SIZE. THERE ARE NO VERY LARGE ENGLISH BOOKPLATES BUT PLENTY OF LIBRARY OWNERS IN THIS COUNTRY HAD TWO OR THREE DIFFERENT SIZED BOOKPLATES AND THE LATE SIR WILLIAM STIRLINGMAXWELL BOASTED OF OVER A HUNDRED VARIETIES  FOOTNOTES   AMONG THE LATE SIR BERNARD BURKES PAPERS THERE WAS DISCOVERED A COLLECTION OF BOOKPLATES SAID TO HAVE BEEN FORMED IN IRELAND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY BUT THERE IS NOTHING TO SHOW THAT THE COLLECTION WAS FORMED AS A COLLECTION OF BOOKPLATES QUA BOOKPLATES.   THERE ARE TWO VARIETIES OF THIS BOOKPLATE.   MOORE VOL. I. P. .     CHAPTER II  THE EARLY USE OF BOOKPLATES IN ENGLAND   IN A SHORT PAPER WHICH IN  I CONTRIBUTED TO THE ANTIQUARIAN MAGAZINE AND BIBLIOGRAPHER I WROTE THIS PASSAGEIT IS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT THE GENERAL USE OF BOOKPLATES SHOULD HAVE BEEN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS IN REACHING THIS COUNTRY FROM THE CONTINENT AND YET THERE IS RATHER MORE DIFFERENCE THAN THAT BETWEEN THE DATE ON THE EARLIESTKNOWN GERMAN EXAMPLE  AND THE TIME WHEN ENGLISHDATED SPECIMENS APPEAR AT ALL PLENTIFULLY. SURELY THE MANY ENGLISH MEN OF LETTERS WHO AMASSED LARGE LIBRARIES IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY AND THE FIRST HALF OF THE SEVENTEENTH MUST HAVE POSSESSED BOOKPLATES AND YET WHERE ARE THEIR BOOKPLATES NOW  MANY NO DOUBT HAVE PERISHED WITH THE BINDINGS TO WHICH THEY WERE FASTENED BUT SOME ARE DOUBTLESS STILL EXTANT AND WE MAY YET HOPE THAT WHEN THE INTEREST IN THESE LABELS BECOMES MORE WIDELY DIFFUSED MORE THAN ONE OR TWO SPECIMENS WILL BE BROUGHT TO LIGHT BEARING AN ENGRAVED DATE SUFFICIENTLY EARLY TO DISPEL THE IDEA THAT THIS COUNTRY WAS A CENTURY AND A HALF BEHIND ITS GERMAN NEIGHBOURS IN THE GENERAL PRACTICE OF USING BOOKPLATES.  MR. DANIEL PARSONS WHO MAY BE PROPERLY CALLED THE FATHER OF BOOKPLATE LITERATUREHIS CONTRIBUTION IN  TO THE THIRD ANNUAL REPORT OF THE OXFORD UNIVERSITY ARCHOLOGICAL AND HERALDIC SOCIETY WAS CERTAINLY THE FIRST PAPER ON THE SUBJECT THAT EVER APPEAREDCOMMENTED ON THIS HOPE OF MINE IN THE NUMBER OF THE SAME MAGAZINE ISSUED IN THE FOLLOWING JANUARY AND WAS DESPONDENT AS TO EVIDENCE BEING FORTHCOMING TO PROVE THE EARLY USE OF BOOKPLATES IN ENGLAND.  WELL IN THAT I EXPRESSED THE BELIEF THAT INVESTIGATION WOULD BRING TO LIGHT A NUMBER OF SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURY DATED BOOKPLATES I WAS PERHAPS WRONGEARLY ENGLISH DATED BOOKPLATES HAVE NOT BEEN FOUND IN ANYTHING APPROACHING PLENTY BUT I WAS ALSO WRONG IN SUGGESTING THAT PROOF OF THE EARLY USE OF BOOKPLATES IN THIS COUNTRY COULD ONLY BE PROVED BY DATED EXAMPLES THE EXISTENCE OF EXAMPLES WHICH FROM INTERNAL EVIDENCE ARE PROVED TO BE OF EARLY DATE IS REALLY EQUALLY VALUABLE AND AS THESE HAVE CERTAINLY COME TO LIGHT IN CONSIDERABLE NUMBERS I THINK A GOOD CASE HAS BEEN MADE OUT ON BEHALF OF OUR FELLOWCOUNTRYMEN.  I DO NOT PRETEND THAT EARLY ENGLISH BOOKPLATES ARE SO PLENTIFUL AS THOSE OF GERMANY. SOME INDIVIDUAL SPECIMENS ARE KNOWN TO EXIST BUT THERE ARE VERY FEW THAT ARE RECORDED AS EXISTING IN MORE THAN A FEW COLLECTIONS AND SOME ARE UNIQUE. FROM SOME CAUSE OR OTHER EARLY ENGLISH BOOKPLATES ARE A RARITY AND I PROPOSE THEREFORE TO SPEAK INDIVIDUALLY OF THE MAJORITY OF THEMTHAT IS TO SAY OF THOSE EXECUTED PRIOR TO THE CLOSE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.  BUT BEFORE DOING THIS LET ME SAY A WORD AS TO THE DATE AT WHICH THE COLOURS INTENDED TO BE SHOWN ON THE SHIELD OF ARMS WERE FIRST REPRESENTED BY LINES OR POINTS. FOR INSTANCE PERPENDICULAR LINES FROM THE TOP TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SHIELD THUS  ILLUSTRATION  TO EXPRESS GULESRED.  A NUMBER OF SMALL DOTS OR POINTS THUS  ILLUSTRATION  TO EXPRESS ORGOLD AND SO ON.  TO WHOM MAY BE ATTACHED THE CREDIT OF INVENTING THIS USEFUL SYSTEM MATTERS LITTLE WHAT WE ARE NOW INTERESTED INFOR THE PURPOSE OF CONSIDERING THE APPROXIMATE DATES OF BOOKPLATESIS THE TIME AT WHICH IT WAS FIRST EMPLOYED IN HERALDIC ENGRAVINGS. MR. WALTER HAMILTON IN THE PAGES OF THE EX LIBRIS JOURNAL REALISES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SUBJECT. HE SPEAKS OF THE WORK BY FATHER SILVESTER PETRASANCTA PUBLISHED AT ROME IN  IN WHICH THE PROPOSAL IS ADVOCATED AND REFERS TO M. HENRI BOUCHOTS ALLUSION TO A WORK BY VULSSON DE LA COLOMBIRE WRITTEN IN  WHICH ADVOCATES THE SYSTEM.  THAT AT AN EARLIER DATE LINES RUNNING ALL IN ONE DIRECTION WERE USED ONLY AS SHADING IS SHOWN OVER AND OVER AGAIN. TAKE FOR INSTANCE THE BOOKPLATE OF FRANCIS DE MALHERBE REPRODUCED OVER LEAF WHICH AS THE OWNER DIED IN  WAS ENGRAVED PROBABLY SOON AFTER THE OPENING OF THE CENTURY. IN THIS CASE WE HAVE A STATEMENT BY DE MALHERBE THAT HIS ARMS ARE DARGENT  SIX ROSES DE GUEULES ET DES HERMINES DE SABLE SANS NOMBREA DESCRIPTION OBVIOUSLY INACCURATE. DE MALHERBE WAS A POET AND COULD NO MORE BE EXPECTED TO DESCRIBE A COAT OF ARMS THAN GARTER COULD BE EXPECTED TO WRITE A POEM. THE PROPER BLAZONING OF HIS FAMILY ARMS IS ERMINE SIX ROSES GULES. BUT ACCORDING TO THE LINES DEPICTED ON HIS BOOKPLATE THE FIELD WOULD BE AZURE CLEARLY IN THIS CASE THE LINES MEAN NOTHING AT ALL.  THE LATE MR. J. E. BAILEY POINTS OUT THAT IN THE   AND  EDITIONS OF GERARD LEGHS ACCEDENS OF ARMORY SABLE BLACK IS EXPRESSED AS IT WOULD BE NOW BY HORIZONTAL AND PERPENDICULAR LINES CROSSING EACH OTHER WHILST THE OTHER COLOURS ARE REPRESENTED BY THE INITIALS OF THEIR NAMES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THIS FORM OF EXPRESSING SABLE MAY BE MERELY THE RESULT OF AN ATTEMPT ON THE PART OF THE ENGRAVER TO PRODUCE AS DARK A TINT AS POSSIBLE TO REPRESENT IT. IN VINCENTS DISCOVERY OF BROOKES ERRORS  SUCH LINES ARE CERTAINLY USED AS SHADING OR TO DISTINGUISH COLOUR FROM WHITE BUT AS SHOWN FROM HIS VERBAL DESCRIPTION OF THE ARMS HE REPRESENTS THESE LINES ARE USED WITHOUT ANY SYSTEM WHATEVER PERPENDICULAR LINES SOMETIMES REPRESENTING GULES AND SOMETIMES AZURE. AGAIN IN THE SECOND EDITION OF GUILLIMS DISPLAY  LINES ARE USED TO DENOTE THE DARKER COLOURS THOUGH THEY ARE USED WITHOUT SYSTEM. BUT IN  WE FIND IN BYSSHES HERALDIC TRACTS GULES AZURE SABLE AND THE REST EXPRESSED IN THE NOW ORTHODOX MANNER AND AN EXPLANATORY PLATE SHOWING WHAT COLOURS ARE REPRESENTED BY THE RESPECTIVE DOTS OR LINES A CONCLUSIVE PROOF OF THE NOVELTY OF THE SYSTEM IN ENGLAND. I THINK THE READER WILL SEE AS HE PROCEEDS THAT THIS HAS BEEN A USEFUL DIGRESSION.  ILLUSTRATION BOOKPLATE OF FRANCIS DE MALHERBE.  WE HAVE SAID THAT THE EARLIEST ENGLISH BOOKPLATE YET COME TO LIGHT IS CARDINAL WOLSEYS. THIS IS NOT A PRINTED BOOKPLATE AT ALL BUT A CAREFULLY DRAWN SKETCH OF THE CARDINALS ARMS WITH SUPPORTERS AND SURMOUNTED BY A CARDINALS HAT THE WHOLE COLOURED BY HAND. HOW MANY OF THESE BOOKPLATES THE CARDINAL POSSESSED WE DO NOT KNOW BUT THAT THISTHE ONLY EXAMPLE KNOWNIS UNDOUBTEDLY A BOOKPLATE IS PROVED FROM THE FACT THAT IT MAY NOW BE SEEN IN A FOLIO VOLUME WHICH ONCE BELONGED TO WOLSEY AND SUBSEQUENTLY TO HIS ROYAL MASTER. IT BEARS NO DATE AND MAY HAVE BEEN DESIGNED ANY TIME AFTER THE MINISTERS ELEVATION TO THE CARDINALATE IN SEPTEMBER . IT IS A SPLENDID AFFAIR IN EVERY WAY AND GORGEOUSLY COLOURED. THE SHIELD OF ARMS RESTS ON A PLATFORM GOLD THE FRONT OF WHICH IS RED ORNAMENTED WITH AN ARABESQUE PATTERN ALSO RED PILLARS ON THE PLATFORM SUPPORT A CANOPY ORNAMENTED AS THE FRONT OF THE PLATFORM WITH THE ADDITION OF TUDOR ROSES OVER THE SHIELD IS THE CARDINALS HAT AND ABOVE THAT AGAIN THE HOLY DOVE DESCENDS. THE SHIELD IS SUPPORTED BY TWO DINGYLOOKING GRIFFINS WHOSE WINGS AND HEADS ARE RED AND WHOSE BEAKS CLAWS AND TAILTIPS ARE GOLD THE BACKGROUND IS BLUE.  ILLUSTRATION BOOKPLATE OF SIR NICHOLAS BACON.  NEXT IN DATE AFTER WOLSEYS BOOKPLATE COMES THAT WHICH WAS I BELIEVE ENGRAVED AT LEAST CONTEMPORANEOUSLY WITH THE DATE UPON IT  TO PLACE IN THE VOLUMES GIVEN IN THAT YEAR BY SIR NICHOLAS BACON TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE. BACON DIED FIVE YEARS AFTER THIS DATE HE IS FAMILIAR TO US ALL AS THE FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY AND OF SIR FRANCIS BACON. THIS BOOKPLATE IS ENGRAVED ON WOOD LIKE WOLSEYS IT IS FOUND COLOURED BUT IT IS ALSOAMONGST THE ODDS AND ENDS IN THE BAGFORD COLLECTIONFOUND UNCOLOURED AND WITHOUT THE INSCRIPTION WHICH RECORDS THE GIFT TO CAMBRIDGE. A FACSIMILE OF THAT IN THE BAGFORD COLLECTION APPEARS OPPOSITE CAN IT BE THE BOOKPLATE OF BACON HIMSELF TO WHICH ON THE COPIES USED FOR THE BOOKS THAT HE GAVE TO CAMBRIDGE WAS ADDED THE DONATORY INSCRIPTION A CLOSE COMPARISON SHOWS THAT BOTH SHIELDS OF ARMS ARE STRUCK FROM THE SAME BLOCK. THE ARMS SHOWN ARE BACON QUARTERING QUAPLODE. THE VARIETY OF THIS BOOKPLATE WHICH BEARS THE INSCRIPTION BELONGS TO WHAT ARE TERMED GIFT OR LEGACY BOOKPLATES THE DATES ON WHICHAS THEY REFER TO THE DATE OF THE GIFT OR LEGACY COMMEMORATEDARE CONSIDERED EARLIER THAN THE ENGRAVING. IN THE CASE OF LEGACY BOOKPLATES THEY MAY OFTEN BE SO BUT THEY ARE NOT I THINK IN MANY CASES OF GIFT BOOKPLATES. FOR INSTANCE IF AS FROM THE BAGFORD EXAMPLE SEEMS PROBABLE THIS WAS BACONS OWN BOOKPLATE THE DATE UPON IT  MAY EVEN BE MANY YEARS LATER THAN THE TIME AT WHICH IT WAS MADE FOR HIM. THAT THE DATE ON ONE OF THESE GIFT BOOKPLATES MUST BE WITHIN A VERY SHORT SPACE OF TIME THE DATE OF ITS ENGRAVING WILL BE SHOWN PRESENTLY WHEN I COME TO SPEAK OF THAT RECORDING A DONATION MADE BY LADY BATH.  ILLUSTRATION  THE NEXT ENGLISH BOOKPLATE WHICH BEARS UPON IT AN ENGRAVED DATE IS THAT OF SIR THOMAS TRESHAM. ON THIS THE INSCRIPTION READS JUNE   WHICH NO DOUBT REFERS TO THE DATE OF ENGRAVING OR PROBABLY TO THE DATE AT WHICH THE DESIGN FOR THE ENGRAVING WAS FINISHED BY THE ARTIST. AS A WORK OF ART IT IS POOR BUT ITS INTEREST AS A BOOKPLATE TO COLLECTORS IS NOT LESSENED ON THAT ACCOUNT. TRESHAM WAS KNIGHTED BY QUEEN ELIZABETH TEN YEARS BEFORE THE DATE OF HIS BOOKPLATE. WE KNOW NOT MUCH OF HIM SAVE WHAT FULLER TELLS US THAT HE WAS FAMOUS FOR HIS SKILL IN BUILDINGS. ONE OF HIS SONS SIR FRANCIS WAS INVOLVED IN THE GUNPOWDER PLOT AND ANOTHER SIR LEWIS WAS MADE A BARONET IN .  THESE THREE EXAMPLES ARE ALL THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY ENGLISH DATED BOOKPLATES YET BROUGHT TO LIGHT. THOSE IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY ARE FAR MORE NUMEROUS. WE FIND ONE BEARING THE DATE  WHICH WAS PREPARED TO PLACE IN THE VOLUMES GIVEN IN THAT YEAR BY WILLIAM WILLMER A NORTHAMPTONSHIRE SQUIRE TO HIS COLLEGE LIBRARY. THE INSCRIPTION ON IT READS SYDNEY SUSSEX COLLEDGEEX DONO WILHELMI WILLMER DE SYWELL IN COM. NORTHAMTONI ARMIGERI QUONDAM PENTIONARII IN ISTA DOMI SIC VIZ. IN ANNO DI  SED DEDIT IN ANO DI . THE BOOKPLATE IS CLEARLY EARLY AND SHOWS US FINE BOLD HERALDIC WORK. IN STYLE IT NEARLY RESEMBLES THE BACON PLATE AND THAT OF SIR THOMAS TRESHAM BUT THE MANTLING HERE DESCENDS TO THE BASE OF THE SHIELD. THE WILLMER PLATE IS IN DR. HOWARDS COLLECTION A REPRODUCTION OF IT IS GIVEN IN MR. GRIGGSS EXAMPLES OF ARMORIAL BOOKPLATES.  EARLY IN THE REIGN OF CHARLES I. MAY BE PLACED A VERY BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLE OF HERALDIC ENGRAVING WHICH SIR WOLLASTON FRANKS SATISFACTORILY ASSIGNS TO A CERTAIN JOHN TALBOT OF THORNETON WHO DIED IN . IT IS INSCRIBED COLL. TALBOTT AND THIS JOHN TALBOT IS CALLED COLONELLUS EX PARTE REGIS THE QUARTERINGS ARE THOSE OF THE FAMILIES OF FERRERS BELLARS AND ARDERNE.  IN STRANGE CONTRAST TO THIS FINE WORK IS THE WOOD BLOCK BOOKPLATE OF WILLIAM COURTENAY OF TREEMER IN THE COUNTY OF CORNWALL ESQUIRE WHO IN  INHERITED THE TREEMER ESTATE. WE MAY NOTE THAT NOT ONLY IS THIS BOOKPLATE LIKE ALL THOSE YET DESCRIBED FREE FROM ANY INDICATION OF LINES OR DOTS TO EXPRESS THE COLOURS IN THE ARMORIAL BEARINGS BUT BELOW THE SHIELD IS GIVEN A VERBAL BLAZON OF THE COAT HE BEARETH OR  TORTEAUXES.  THIS SEEMS TO BE THE PLACE TO SPEAK OF A VERY PUZZLING PAIR OF ENGRAVINGS WHICH CERTAINLY APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN USED AS BOOKPLATES DATED IN . THEY REPRESENT THE ARMORIAL BEARINGS OF SIR EDWARD DERING. ONE OF THESE BOOKPLATES WHICH I TAKE TO BE THE EARLIER SHOWS A LESS NUMBER OF QUARTERINGS AND CONTAINS NO INDICATION OF A REALLY SYSTEMATIC EXPRESSION OF THE METALS AND TINCTURES IN THE ARMS BUT THE OTHER AND LATER EXAMPLE DOES. THE SAME DATE APPEARS UPON EACH. THE SECOND OF THE TWO PLATES OCCURS BOUND UP IN A VOLUME OF THE HARLEIAN COLLECTION OF MSS. AND MR. HUMPHREY WANLY LIBRARYKEEPER TO ROBERT AND EDWARD EARLS OF OXFORD IN HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIMEN IN THE HARLEIAN COLLECTION CALLS IT A PRINTED CUT OF THE ARMS OR ATCHIEVEMENT OF SIR EDWARD DERING BARONET DATED A.D.  WITH A FANCIFUL MOTTO IN MISSHAPEN SAXON CHARACTERS BUT BY THE HATCHING OF THE ARMS IN ORDER TO SHOW THE COLOURS ACCORDING TO THE WAY FOUND OUT BY SIR EDWARD BYSSHE I GUESS THAT IT IS NOT SO OLD.  NOW THE HARLEIAN VOLUME IN WHICH THIS ENGRAVING OCCURS IS A COPY WRITTEN IN  OF THE HERALDS VISITATION OF KENT IN  AND IN A LATER BUT CERTAINLY SEVENTEENTH CENTURY HANDWRITING IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE NUMEROUS QUARTERINGS AS THEY APPEAR ON THE ENGRAVING SO THAT WHILST REJECTING THE CLAIM OF THIS VARIETY OF THE PLATE TO BE AN ENGRAVING OF  WE MAY I THINK ACCEPT IT AS AT LEAST AN EARLY EXAMPLE OF THE INDICATION OF THE COLOURS AND TINCTURES BY LINES AND DOTS. AS FOR THE FIRST OF THE TWO VARIETIES I DO NOT SEE WHY IT SHOULD NOT BE AS EARLY AS THE DATE UPON IT THERE WAS NO PARTICULAR REASON IN SELECTING THAT DATE FOR I DO NOT FIND THAT IT REFERS TO ANY SPECIAL EVENT IN SIR EDWARDS LIFE. A WRITER TO NOTES AND QUERIES IN  STATES THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL LOOSE COPIES OF THE PLATEWHICH VARIETY HE DOES NOT SAYIN THE SURRENDEN COLLECTION AND DR. HOWARD SAW IT INSERTED IN SEVERAL FOLIO VOLUMES OF THAT COLLECTION WHEN IT WAS DISPOSED OF BY MESSRS. PUTTICK AND SIMPSON. VERY GOOD FACSIMILES OF THESE BOOKPLATES HAVE BEEN GIVEN BY DR. HOWARD IN HIS MISCELLANEA GENEALOGICA ET HERALDICA.  ANOTHER EARLY INSTANCE OF THE EXPRESSION OF THE METALS AND TINCTURES OCCURS IN THE BOOKPLATE OF LORDKEEPER LYTTELTON A PLATE WHICH DERIVES ADDITIONAL INTEREST FROM THE FACT OF ITS BEING THE WORK OF WILLIAM MARSHALL THE FAMOUS FRONTISPIECE ENGRAVER. SIR EDWARD LYTTELTON THE OWNER OF THE BOOKPLATE WAS MADE LORDKEEPER IN  UNDER THE TITLE OF BARON LYTTELTON OF MOUNSLOW. THIS BOOKPLATE WHICH SHOWS US THE ARMS OF LYTTELTON OF FRANKLEY WAS EVIDENTLY ENGRAVED BEFORE SIR EDWARDS ELEVATION TO THE PEERAGE. THE BOOKPLATE WHICH IS THE EARLIEST ENGLISH EXAMPLE BEARING AN ENGRAVERS SIGNATURE MAY BE DATED ABOUT .  WE KNOW FROM THE ARMS ON DEDICATION PLATES AND THE LIKE THAT THE EXPRESSION OF COLOURS ON SHIELDS DID NOT BECOME AT ALL GENERAL FOR MANY YEARS AFTER . TAKE FOR INSTANCE HOLLARS CUTS OF ARMS IN THE ILLUSTRATIONS TO DUGDALES MONASTICON OR HIS HISTORY OF ST. PAULS. THUS WE MUST NOT DATE EVERY BOOKPLATE WE FIND ON WHICH THE COLOURS ARE NOT SHOWN IN THE NEW FASHION AS BEFORE . THE SMALL AND UNPRETENTIOUS BOOKPLATE OF JOHN MARSHAM OF WHOMS PLACE NEAR CUXTON IN KENT IS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THIS. A REPRESENTATION OF IT IS GIVEN BY MR. GRIGGS IN HIS FACSIMILES. MARSHAM WAS MADE A BARONET IN  SO THE PLATE IS EARLIER THAN THAT BUT AS IT IS EXACTLY IN THE STYLE OF THE DEDICATORY PLATES IN THE WORKS JUST NOTICED WE MAY PLACE IT SOMEWHERE ABOUT . IT IS PERHAPS BY HOLLAR. LIKELY ENOUGH OTHER EXAMPLES WILL COME TO LIGHT.  AFTER THE RESTORATION THE NUMBER OF ENGLISH BOOKPLATES PERCEPTIBLY INCREASES THOUGH WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THE ACTIVE SUPPORTERS OF CROMWELL DID NOT OBJECT TO A LITTLE HERALDIC DISPLAYTHERE WAS A FAIR AMOUNT OF HERALDIC WORK ONE WAY AND ANOTHER EXECUTED BOTH WITH PEN AND PENCIL DURING THE TWELVE YEARS THAT THE KING WAS KEPT OFF HIS THRONE. TWO OF THE EARLIEST POSTRESTORATION BOOKPLATES ARE THOSE OF SIR EDWARD BYSSHE AND HIS BROTHERINLAW JOHN GREENE. SIR EDWARD BYSSHE BECAME GARTER KINGATARMS AND JOHN GREENE WAS OF NAVESTOCK ESSEX. BOTH ARE CURIOUS OBLONG PLATES HAVING FANCIFULLY SHAPED SHIELDS SURROUNDED BY PALM BRANCHES AND HELD UP BY RIBBONS. THERE IS NO CREST SHOWN IN EITHER. THEY ARE EVIDENTLY BY THE SAME ARTIST WHICH AS BYSSHE AND GREENE WERE BROTHERSINLAW IS PERHAPS NATURAL. A SOMEWHAT SIMILAR THOUGH PLAINER FORM OF ORNAMENTATION SURROUNDS THE SHIELDS ON TWO OTHER ANONYMOUS BOOKPLATES ONE BEARING THE ARMS OF SOUTHWELL AND THE OTHER THOSE OF EYNES OR HAYNES.  ILLUSTRATION BOOKPLATE OF THOMAS GORE BY MICHAEL BURGHERS.  THOMAS GORE OF ALDERTON WILTS THE AUTHOR OF CATALOGUS DE RE HERALDIC IS A MAN WHO MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO USE A BOOKPLATE AND HE DID. THREE VARIETIES ARE KNOWN. THE FIRST WHICH DATES ABOUT  THOUGH A MORE ELABORATE PIECE OF WORK THAN THOSE LAST DESCRIBED IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR IN STYLE OR PERHAPS IT WOULD BE MORE ACCURATE TO SAY DISSIMILAR TO THE STYLE IN WHICH OTHER BOOKPLATES PRIOR TO THE RESTORATION WERE DESIGNED. WHOEVER ENGRAVED THIS PLATE FOR GORE ALSO ENGRAVED THE ARMS OF EDWARD WATERHOUSEMOST PROBABLY THE ENGRAVING WAS INTENDED FOR WATERHOUSES BOOKPLATEWHICH APPEAR AS A FRONTISPIECE TO HIS DISCOURSE AND DEFENCE OF ARMS AND ARMORY . IN HIS SECOND BOOKPLATE GORE CALLED TO HIS AID THE FOREIGNERS ART EMPLOYING MICHAEL BURGHERS A DUTCH ARTIST WHO HAD RECENTLY COME FROM HOLLAND AND SETTLED AT OXFORD. MICHAEL PRODUCED THE BOOKPLATE FIGURED OPPOSITE WHICH INTRODUCES SOME RATHER WILD ALLEGORY SINGULARLY PLAIN CUPIDS SEATED ON THE BACKS OF FLYING EAGLES. PERHAPS GORE DID NOT CARE FOR THIS ALLEGORYALLEGORY SEEMS NEVER TO HAVE BEEN POPULAR WITH ENGLISH BOOKPLATE OWNERS SEE CHAPTER IV.AND FOR HIS THIRD PLATE WENT TO AN ENGLISHMAN AND TO A NO LESS EMINENT ONE THAN WILLIAM FAITHORNE. THE FAMOUS PORTRAITENGRAVER PRODUCED AS BEAUTIFUL AND BOLD A BOOKPLATE IN THE SIMPLE ARMORIAL STYLE AS COULD WELL BE THE PECULIAR DEPTH OF HIS TOUCH IS APPARENT HERE AND IN HIS OTHER BOOKPLATES OF WHICH THERE ARE SEVERAL.  ILLUSTRATION BOOKPLATE OF THE MARRIOTT FAMILY BY FAITHORNE  IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT FAITHORNE REVERTS TO THE PRERESTORATION STYLE AND IMPROVES UPON IT. THE MANTLING IS MUCH RICHER THAN THAT SHOWN IN EARLIER EXAMPLES IN THE SAME STYLE AND IT MORE COMPLETELY SURROUNDS THE SHIELD. TO FAITHORNE MAY BE ASSIGNED TWO OTHER MAGNIFICENT BOOKPLATES THAT OF SIR GEORGE HUNGERFORD OF CADENHAM ANONYMOUS AND THE ONE HERE REPRODUCED OF A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY OF MARRIOTT OF WHITCHURCH WARWICKSHIRE AND ALSCOT AND PRESTON GLOUCESTERSHIRE. THE HUNGERFORD BOOKPLATE IS NOTEWORTHY. THE NAME OF SIR GEORGE HUNGERFORD ITS POSSESSOR DOES NOT OCCUR IN ANY LIST OF BARONETS YET HE EVIDENTLY CONSIDERED HIMSELF TO POSSESS THAT DIGNITY AS THE BLOODY HAND OF ULSTER FIGURES ON HIS ARMS. DUGDALE TOO IN SPEAKING OF SIR GEORGES MARRIAGE REFERS TO HIM AS BARONET. FAITHORNE ALSO PRODUCED A BOOKPLATE TO COMMEMORATE A GIFT OF BOOKS MADE BY BISHOP HACKET WHO DIED IN IT IS PARTICULARLY CURIOUS AS SHOWING US THE BISHOPS PORTRAIT. I SHALL SPEAK OF IT LATER ON UNDER THE HEADING PORTRAIT BOOKPLATES PP.  SUCH PLATES ARE COMPARATIVELY FEW IN NUMBER.  DATED AND MOST PROBABLY ENGRAVED IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR  IS ANOTHER GIFT BOOKPLATE PREPARED TO PLACE IN BOOKS PRESENTED BY THE THEN COUNTESSDOWAGER OF BATH. THE INSCRIPTION READS EX DONO RACHEL COMITISS BATHON DOTARI AN DOM. MDCLXXI. THIS LADY WAS BORN IN  SHE WAS A DAUGHTER OF FRANCIS FANE FIRST EARL OF WESTMORELAND AND BECAME THE WIFE OF HENRY BOURCHIER EARL OF BATH WHO DIED IN  AND SOON AFTERWARDS OF LIONEL CRANFIELD EARL OF MIDDLESEX WHO DIED IN  SHE HERSELF DYING IN . THERE IS NO REASON TO DOUBT THE DATE ON THIS BOOKPLATE  THOUGH AT FIRST SIGHT IT MAY LOOK A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS. TRUE SHE HAD BECOME THE WIFE OF THE EARL OF MIDDLESEX A TITLE ONLY DATING FROM  IN  AND WAS STILL HIS WIFE IN  BUT SHE HAD APPARENTLY LITTLE REASON TO BE PROUD OF HIM OR HIS TITLE FOR HE LEFT HER AND MADE HAY OF HER FORTUNE SPENDING IT TO USE THE WORDS OF A CONTEMPORARY LETTER IN PLAY AND RIOTING. WE CANNOT THEREFORE FEEL MUCH SURPRISED AT HER DESIRE TO PASS BY HER FORMER TITLE WHICH WOULD GIVE HER RANK AT COURT AS THE WIDOW OF AN EARL WHOSE CREATION WAS HARD ON A CENTURY EARLIER. OUR COUSIN LADY BATH WRITES LADY NEWPORT IN APRIL  HATH GOT HER PLACE OF BEING LADY BATH AGAIN IT COST HER L . . . HER LORD IS VERY ANGRY AT HER CHANGING HER TITLE HE SAYS IT IS AN AFFRONT TO HIM. THAT IS WHY SHE CALLS HERSELF ON THE BOOKPLATE UNDER NOTICE COUNTESSDOWAGER OF BATH IN . A CURIOUS FEATURE ABOUT THE BOOKPLATE IS THAT IT DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE BEEN PREPARED TO PLACE IN BOOKS INCLUDED IN ONE PARTICULAR GIFT TO A PARTICULAR PERSON OR INSTITUTION BUT RATHER TO HAVE BEEN THE OUTCOME OF MY LADYS FANCY TO PLACE SUCH A REMEMBRANCE OF HERSELF IN ANY VOLUME SHE GAVE AWAY AT THAT OR AT ANY SUBSEQUENT DATE. THE COUNTESS ALSO USED A BOOKSTAMP OF THE SAME DESIGN AS THE EX LIBRIS BUT WITHOUT THE INSCRIPTION.  WHILST SPEAKING ON THE SUBJECT OF GIFT BOOKPLATES REFERENCE MAY APPROPRIATELY BE MADE TO A CURIOUS WOODCUT USED AS A BOOKPLATE BY THE ST. ALBANS GRAMMAR SCHOOL WHICH IS FIGURED OPPOSITE THE NEXT PAGE. IT IS A QUAINT BIT OF NO DOUBT LOCAL WORK AND AS POINTED OUT TO ME BY THE REV. F. WILLCOX THE HEADMASTER DURING A LONG AND DUSTY HUNT OCCURS ONLY IN THE VOLUMES GIVEN TO THE SCHOOL BY SIR SAMUEL GRIMSTON. THE PLATE SHOWS US A COMBINATION OF THE ARMS OF THE CITY OF ST. ALBANS AND THE MOTTO OF THE BACON FAMILY ADOPTED BY THE GRIMSTONS.  I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IF A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF THE TOO OFTEN NEGLECTED LIBRARIES OF OUR OLD FOUNDATION GRAMMAR SCHOOLS WERE MADE OTHER EARLY AND CURIOUS BOOKPLATES MIGHT BE DISCOVERED.  BETWEEN  AND  QUITE A NUMBER OF BOOKPLATES WERE DESIGNED EVIDENTLY BY THE SAME MAN. THE WORK IS FEEBLE BUT IT IS VERY DISTINCT. THE MOST INTERESTING OF THESE BOOKPLATES FROM ITS POSSESSOR IS THAT OF SAMUEL PEPYS. ALTOGETHER I KNOW OF EIGHT EXAMPLES CHARLES PITFIELD SIR ROBERT SOUTHWELL WILLIAM WHARTON SIR HENRY HUNLOKE SAMUEL PEPYS JUSTINIAN PAGIT WALTER CHETWYND AND RANDOLPH EGERTON.  A POINT OF INTEREST ABOUT THEM ALL IS THAT AS WELL AS EXPRESSING HERALDICALLY THE BLAZON OF THE DIFFERENT SHIELDS THEY ALSO INDICATE WITH AN INITIAL LETTER THE COLOUR INTENDED TO BE SHOWN A FOR ARGENT G FOR GULES AND SO ON. THE INITIAL OF THE HERALDIC TERM IS USED IN EVERY CASE EXCEPT THAT OF AZURE WHEN B FOR BLUE IS USED A AS WE HAVE SEEN STANDING FOR ARGENT.  THOUGH THEY DIFFER IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE MANTLING THERE CAN BE LITTLE DOUBT THAT ALL THESE BOOKPLATES ARE BY THE SAME HAND AND THAT WHOEVER ENGRAVED THE PLATES IN BLOMES GWILIM ENGRAVED THESE ALSO.  THE BOOKPLATE OF FETTIPLACE NOTT WHICH BEARS THE DATE  IS A FAIR TYPE OF THE BOOKPLATE THAT WAS IN USE IN ENGLAND FOR THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS INDEED THESE MIGHT ALL BE THE WORK OF HALF A DOZEN ARTISTS.  ILLUSTRATION BOOKPLATE OF THE ST. ALBANS GRAMMAR SCHOOL SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.  I HAVE NOT YET MENTIONED A VERY NUMEROUS AND VERY UNINTERESTING CLASS OF EARLY ENGLISH BOOKPLATESI MEAN THOSE WHICH ARE NOTHING MORE THAN NAMETICKETSTHE OWNERS NAME AND DATE PRINTED WITHIN A BORDER MORE OR LESS ORNATE. THESE OCCUR QUITE EARLY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY AND RUN ALL THROUGH IT. OF COURSE IT MAY BE THAT THE OWNER IS AN INTERESTING PERSON AND THEN HIS OR HER NAMETICKET BECOMES INTERESTING BY REFLECTION BUT IN THEMSELVES THESE TICKETS ARE MERELY DULL. OF ENGLISH ARMORIAL PLATES I HAVE REFERRED IN DETAIL TO THE MAJORITY OF THOSE BEARING AN ENGRAVED DATEWHEN THAT DATE IS NOT OBVIOUSLY MISLEADINGPRIOR TO THE YEAR . I HAVE ALSO SPOKEN OF SEVERAL THOUGH BY NO MEANS ALL OF THE UNDATED EXAMPLES WHICH HAVE BEEN PROVED TO BELONG TO THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY. TO THIS SECOND LIST A PATIENT WORKING OUT OF THE INTERNAL EVIDENCE ON EARLYLOOKING BUT UNDATED BOOKPLATES WOULD NO DOUBT ADD VERY CONSIDERABLY AND THE ILLUSTRATIONS VERBAL AND OTHERWISE THAT I HAVE GIVEN MAY I HOPE BE SUFFICIENT TO INDICATE THE KIND OF BOOKPLATES THAT ARE WORTH SUCH INVESTIGATION.  I HAVE USED THE DATE  AS A STOPPINGPOINT BECAUSE FROM THAT YEAR WE HAVE DATED EXAMPLES OF ENGLISH BOOKPLATES YEARLY DOWN TO THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE PRESENT CENTURY. HERE LET ME SAY A WORD ON THE SUBJECT OF DATED BOOKPLATES GENERALLY. THE DATE IS CERTAINLY AN ADVANTAGE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT CLEARLY REFERS TO THE DATE OF THE ENGRAVING AND NOT AS WE HAVE SEEN IT SOMETIMES DOES TO AN EVENT IN THE OWNERS CAREER BUT I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE MARKET VALUE OF A BOOKPLATE SHOULD BE ENHANCED TO SUCH AN EXTENT AS IT IS BY THE PRESENCE ON THAT BOOKPLATE OF AN ENGRAVED DATE. THERE ARE PROBABLY FEW BOOKPLATES WHICH DO NOT BEAR SOME MARK BY WHICH AN APPROXIMATE DATE CAN BE SAFELY AFFIXED TO THEM AND THE STUDY OF THESE MARKS IS A VERY DESIRABLE UNDERTAKING. THE GREAT VALUE OF A PRINTED DATE ON A BOOKPLATE IS THAT ONE CAN SEE FROM IT THE STYLE OF DECORATION IN VOGUE AT A PARTICULAR PERIOD AND THUS OBTAIN THE MEANS FOR ARRANGING CHRONOLOGICALLY UNDATED EXAMPLES. FOR THERE WERE DURING CERTAIN YEARS CERTAIN MARKED STYLES OF DECORATION ADOPTED BY BOOKPLATE ENGRAVERS BUT OF THESE I PROPOSE TO SPEAK LATER ON UNDER THE HEADING OF STYLES.  LET ME ALSO MENTION MISLEADING DATES ON BOOKPLATES AND FOR THIS PURPOSE IT WILL BE SUFFICIENT IF I TAKE PRINCIPALLY THE EXAMPLES CITED BY MR. J. PAUL RYLANDS F.S.A. IN HIS NOTES ON LANCASHIRE AND CHESHIRE EXAMPLES. THE DATE ON SIR WILLIAM ST. QUINTINS BOOKPLATE  IS THAT AT WHICH THE BARONETCY WAS CREATED THE BOOKPLATE WAS ENGRAVED IN THE LAST CENTURY. SIR FRANCIS FUSTS BOOKPLATE ONE REMARKABLE FOR ITS SIZE AND UGLINESS IS INSCRIBED SR FRANCIS FUST OF HILL COURT IN THE COUNTY OF GLOUCESTER BARONET CREATED ST AUGUST  THE  YEAR OF KING CHARLES D. NOW THIS PLATE CANNOT BE EARLIER THAN  THE YEAR IN WHICH THE FIRST SIR FRANCIS SUCCEEDED TO THE BARONETCY. HERE HOWEVER THE CONTEXT OF WORDS CREATED ST AUGUST  RENDERS THE INSCRIPTION LESS LIKELY TO MISLEAD PEOPLE INTO SUPPOSING THAT  WAS THE YEAR IN WHICH THE PLATE WAS EXECUTED. IN OTHER INSTANCES WE HAVE NOT THIS HELP.  THE DATE  ON THE BOOKPLATE OF GILBERT NICHOLSON OF BALRATH MERELY REFERS TO THE DATE AT WHICH GILBERT ACQUIRED HIS IRISH ESTATES THE EXAMPLE ITSELF MUST BE LATER THAN  AS THE SAME COPPER WAS EMPLOYED FOR IT AS THAT ON WHICH THE BOOKPLATE OF THOMAS CARTER DATED IN THAT YEAR HAD BEEN ENGRAVED. AGAIN SOME COLLECTORS HOLD AND HAVE MAINTAINED IN PRINT THAT THE BOOKPLATE OF SIR ROBERT CLAYTON OF WHICH WE MUST SPEAK AGAIN HEREAFTER WAS NOT REALLY ENGRAVED IN THE DATE WHICH APPEARS UPON IT.  IS THE YEAR IN WHICH SIR ROBERT WAS LORD MAYOR OF LONDON AND IT IS THOUGHT PROBABLE THAT THE BOOKPLATE WAS ENGRAVED LATERPERHAPS IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY WHEN AS WE HAVE SEEN THE FASHION OF HAVING A BOOKPLATE WAS SO PREVALENTAND THAT SIR ROBERT PLACED THE DATE  UPON IT IN ORDER TO COMMEMORATE THE DATE OF HIS MAYORALTY. FOR MY PART I SEE NO PARTICULAR REASON FOR HOLDING THIS VIEW THE STYLE IN WHICH THE PLATE IS EXECUTED DOES NOT SEEM TO ME CONTRADICTORY TO THE DATE UPON IT. STILL AS THE DOUBT EXISTS IT IS BETTER TO MENTION IT.  ATTENTION HAS BEEN CALLED TO A BOOKPLATE OF DAVID PAYNTER OF DALE CASTLE PEMBROKESHIRE  WHICH IS PROBABLY NEARLY A CENTURY LATER. THE BOOKPLATE OF WILLIAM TWEMLOW OF HATHERTON CHESHIRE ESQUIRE  WAS ENGRAVED FOR A MR. WILLIAM TWEMLOW WHO DIED IN .  ILLUSTRATION  ON THE OTHER HAND THERE ARE CERTAIN BOOKPLATES WHICH WERE ENGRAVED EARLIER THAN THE DATES WHICH APPEAR UPON SOME IMPRESSIONS OF THEM. THE BOOKPLATE OF THE STATESMAN CHARLES JAMES FOX SEE OPPOSITE IS ONE INSTANCE OF THIS. IT IS INSCRIBED THE HONBLE CHARLES JAMES FOX AND WAS USED BY THE GREAT STATESMAN BUT THE PLATE WAS ENGRAVED IN AS ITS STYLE SUGGESTSFOR HIS HALFUNCLE AND THE INSCRIPTION BEFORE ITS ALTERATION READCHARLES FOX OF THE PARISH OF ST. MARTINSINTHEFIELDS ESQ. .  THERE IS A LARGE BOOKPLATE SHOWN BY ITS STYLE TO HAVE BEEN ENGRAVED IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY BUT WHICH IS INSCRIBED MARTIN STAPYLTON ESQ. OF MYTON IN THE COUNTY OF YORK A.D. . THE BOOKPLATE WAS EVIDENTLY ENGRAVED FOR SIR BRYAN STAPYLTON WHO DIED IN . THE MARTIN STAPYLTON WHO ALTERED AND USED IT WAS ONE MARTIN BREENEPHEW OF THE LAST BARONET WHO DIED IN WHO SUCCEEDED TO HIS UNCLES PROPERTY BUT NOT TO HIS BARONETCY HENCE HE WAS NOT JUSTIFIED IN LEAVING THE HELMET OF A KNIGHT OR BARONET UPON IT HE REMOVED THE BLOODY HAND OF ULSTER FROM THE SHIELD BUT THE MISTAKE IN THE HELMET DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE STRUCK HIM. ON A SMALL VARIETY OF THIS BOOKPLATE THE INSCRIPTION ON WHICH IS SIMILARLY ALTERED THE BLOODY HAND REMAINS.  AGAIN THE BOOKPLATE OF SR WILLM ROBINSON BARONETT OF NEWBY IN THE COUNTY OF YORK  WAS ALTEREDBY TURNING THE  INTO A INTO  AND WAS USED BY HIS GRANDSON THAT INSCRIBED JOHN PEACHEY  DESIGNED IN THE CHIPPENDALE STYLE IS QUITE TWENTY YEARS EARLIER AND THAT OF FR. DICKENS ARMIG.  WAS CERTAINLY ENGRAVED HALF A CENTURY BEFORE.  DURING THE TEN OR TWELVE YEARS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE YEAR  THE NUMBER OF ENGLISH DATED BOOKPLATES IS EXCEEDINGLY LARGE. TAKING THE LIST PRINTED FOR PRIVATE DISTRIBUTION BY SIR WOLLASTON FRANKS IN  WE FIND SIXTEEN EXAMPLES IN  SEVEN IN  FIFTEEN IN  SIXTEEN IN  FORTYFOUR IN  FIFTYEIGHT IN  TWENTYSEVEN IN  AND MANY BUT NOT SO MANY IN THE SUCCEEDING YEARS. SOMETHINGWHAT I HAVE FAILED TO DISCOVERMUST HAVE GIVEN A STIMULUS TO THE FASHION OF USING BOOKPLATES JUST AT THE CLOSE OF THE SEVENTEENTH AND OPENING OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY AND NOT ONLY TO USING THEM BUT ALSO TO PUTTING A DATE ON THOSE USED. IT IS A FACT THAT IT IS MORE RARE TO FIND BOOKPLATES ENGRAVED IN THIS PARTICULAR STYLE WITHOUT DATES THAN WITH THEM.  THE FASHION OF DATING AS A RULE WENT OUT ABOUT THE YEAR  ABOUT THE TIME AT WHICH AS WE SHALL SEE A NEW STYLE IN BOOKPLATES BECAME GENERALLY ADOPTED. ANONYMOUS BOOKPLATES ARE RARE AFTER THIS DATE THOUGH BOTH IN ENGLAND AND ON THE CONTINENT THEY WERE IN EARLY TIMES CERTAINLY COMMONA FACT WHICH BEARS SILENT TESTIMONY TO THE MUCH GREATER INTIMACY WHICH PEOPLE IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS HAD WITH THEIR NEIGHBOURS ARMORIAL BEARINGS. THE COAT OF ARMS OF A MAN OF POSITION WAS ALMOST AS WELL KNOWN TO THOSE DWELLING ABOUT HIM AS WERE THE FEATURES OF HIS FACE AND IF A VOLUME HAVING WITHIN IT AN ARMORIAL BOOKPLATE HAPPENED TO BE FOUND IN WRONGFUL CUSTODY THE FINDER MIGHT RECOGNISE THE HERALDRY OF THE OWNER EVEN IF HE COULD NOT READ THE INSCRIPTION RECORDING THAT OWNERSHIP.  SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY USE OF BOOKPLATES IN ENGLAND. IN THE NEXT CHAPTER I PROPOSE TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE LEADING STYLES OF DECORATION EMPLOYED BY THEIR DESIGNERS.  FOOTNOTES   THERE ARE TWO SIZES OF THIS BOOKPLATE.   REPORT BY THE HISTORICAL MSS. COMMISSION ON THE PAPERS OF THE DUKE OF RUTLAND.     CHAPTER III  STYLES IN ENGLISH BOOKPLATES   LORD DE TABLEY HAS GIVEN US NAMES FOR NEARLY ALL THE STYLES MET WITH IN ENGLISH BOOKPLATES AND IT IS PERHAPS BETTER TO ACCEPT THESE DESCRIPTIONS IN THE PRESENT WORK ADDING TO THEM ANOTHERSIMPLE ARMORIALFOR THE EARLIEST PLATES AND INDEED FOR THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THOSE ANTERIOR TO .  IT IS NOT ONLY IN BOOKPLATES THAT WE SEE THIS STYLE ADOPTED IT IS USED IN ALMOST EVERY REPRESENTATION OF SHIELDS OF ARMS IN THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURIES BE IT ON A MEMORIAL BRASS IN SCULPTURE OR ON A STAINED GLASS WINDOW. THE STYLE IS SIMPLE AND EFFECTIVE. THE SHIELD NEARLY ALWAYS SYMMETRICAL IS SURMOUNTED BY A HELMET ON WHICH IS THE WREATH AND CREST. FROM THE HELMET IS OUTSPREAD MORE OR LESS VOLUMINOUS MANTLING. IN THE EARLIER EXAMPLES THIS TERMINATES GENERALLY IN TASSELS BEFORE REACHING THE BASE OF THE SHIELD. IN LATER EXAMPLES ITS HEAVY FOLDS DESCEND QUITE TO THE BASE AND OFTEN ASCEND UPWARDS FROM THE HELMET TO THE LEVEL OF THE TOP OF THE CREST. BELOW THE SHIELD IS A NARROW SCROLL FOR THE MOTTO WHICH IS NOT ALWAYS GIVEN AND AT THE BOTTOM OF ALL IS A BRACKET ON WHICH THE OWNERS NAME IS INSCRIBED HAVING INDENTED EDGES. OCCASIONALLY BUT NOT OFTEN THE MANTLING INSTEAD OF BEING FOLIATED HANGS FROM THE HELMET IN STIFF FOLDS AT THE BACK OF THE SHIELD ITS UPPER CORNERS BEING TIED UP AND TASSELLED. THE BOOKPLATE OF THOMAS KNATCHBULL DATED IN  SHOWN ON P.  IS A VERY FAIR THOUGH NOT A VERY EARLY EXAMPLE OF THIS STYLE. IN SOME INSTANCES THE SHIELD IS PLACED ON ONE SIDEITS RIGHT HAND UPPER CORNER BEING THUS BROUGHT TO THE CENTRE OF THE HELMET. THE SIMPLE ARMORIAL STYLE WAS ROUGHLY SPEAKING NOT MUCH USED AFTER .  BESIDES THE BOOKPLATES DESCRIBED IN THE FOREGOING CHAPTER NEARLY ALL OF WHICH BELONG TO THE ARMORIAL STYLE THERE ARE SUNDRY OTHERS WORTHY OF PARTICULAR OBSERVATION SHOULD THE READER MEET WITH THEM. THERE IS FOR INSTANCE THE BOOKPLATE OF THE RIGHT HONBLE JAMES EARL OF DERBY LORD OF MAN AND YE ISLES  THE GRANDSON OF THE JAMES SEVENTH EARL WHO SUFFERED FOR HIS LOYALTY AND OF THE GALLANT CHARLOTTE TRMOUILLE. THIS IS A LARGE AND VERY STRIKING BOOKPLATE IN EVERY WAY ITS SIZE MAKES POSSIBLE THE INTRODUCTION OF SOME FINE BOLD WORK WHICH IS RENDERED EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE BY THE FACT THAT THE ARMS PORTRAYED ARE SIMPLY THOSE OF STANLEY SO THAT THERE IS NO CROWDING IN OF QUARTERINGS. THE DECORATION IS THAT COMMON TO THE BOOKPLATES OF PEERS OR OF OTHER PERSONS ENTITLED TO USE SUPPORTERS AT THE TIME THE MANTLING SPREADS FROM THE HELMET AND TERMINATES AT THE HEADS OF THE SUPPORTERS THESE STAND UPON THE MOTTOSCROLL. THERE IS A SMALLER VARIETY OF THIS BOOKPLATEONE OF THE ORDINARY SIZEWHICH IS NOT SO PLEASING. WHEN EARL JAMES DIED IN  THE EARLDOM OF DERBY DEVOLVED ON HIS KINSMAN SIR EDWARD STANLEY BART. WHOSE BOOKPLATE LARGER AND FINER THAN THAT JUST DESCRIBED IS REALLY A VERY BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF WORK IN THE JACOBEAN STYLE THE ARMS ARE STANLEY IMPALING HESKETH AND THE SIZE OF THE BOOKPLATE IS    IN.  SIMILAR EXAMPLES OF LARGESIZED BOOKPLATES ARE FURNISHED BY THOSE OF THE HONOURABLE IAMES BRYDGES OF WILTON CASTLE IN HEREFORD SHERE WHERE THE EFFECT IS SOMEWHAT MARRED BY THE NUMBER OF QUARTERINGS DISPLAYED SIR WILLIAM BROWNLOWE OF BELTON IN THE COUNTY OF LINCOLN BARONET  AND HIS WIFE DAME ALICE BROWNLOWE LORD ROOS AND HIS WIFE LADY ROOS PAUL JODRELL OF DUFFIELD IN YE COUNTY OF DERBY ESQR CLERK OF YE HONBLE HOUSE OF COMMONSA PARTICULARLY BOLD PIECE OF WORK AND SR JOHN WENTWORTH OF NORTH ELMESHALL IN THE WEST RIDEING OF YORKSHIRE BARONET. IT IS PROBABLE THAT ALL THESE AND OTHER LARGESIZED ENGLISH BOOKPLATES ALSO EXIST OR EXISTED IN THE ORDINARY SIZE SEE PP.  . THE LARGEST ENGLISH BOOKPLATE AND ONE WHICH FROM ITS UNUSUAL SIZE IS CERTAIN TO ATTRACT ATTENTION IS THAT OF SIMON SCROOPE OF DANBYSUPERYORE IN COM. EBOR. ESQ.  HERE TOO MUCH OF THE GOOD EFFECT IS LOST BY THE NUMBER OF QUARTERINGS NO LESS THAN TWENTYSEVEN INTRODUCED UPON THE SHIELD.  ILLUSTRATION  I REFERRED AT THE CLOSE OF THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF ENGLISH BOOKPLATES ENGRAVED DURING THE LAST TWO YEARS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY AND FIRST TEN OF THE EIGHTEENTH. THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THESE BOOKPLATES ARE IN THE SIMPLE ARMORIAL STYLE AND THERE IS UPON THESE A VERY GREAT SIMILARITY IN THE WAY IN WHICH THAT STYLE IS REPRESENTED INDEED THEY MAY WELL HAVE BEEN ALL OF THEM THE WORK OF LESS THAN A DOZEN ARTISTS. ANY DISTINCTIVE FEATURE THAT EXISTS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE TREATMENT OF THE MANTLING. FOR INSTANCE IT IS FINELY CUT ON THE BOOKPLATES OF NICHOLAS PENNY LORD CORNWALLIS LORD ROOS AND JOHN SAYER OF HOUNSLOW IN THE COUNTY OF MIDD. ESQR ALL DATED IN  ON THE SAYER PLATE THE INSCRIPTION IS ENCLOSED IN A JACOBEAN SCROLL IT IS HEAVY AND STIFFLY CUT IN THE BOOKPLATES OF JAMES BENGOUGH RICHARD NEWDIGATE SIR WILLIAM HUSTLER AND JOHN GODFREY ALL DATED IN  IT IS LEAFLIKE AND GRACEFUL ON THE BOOKPLATES OF WILLIAM THOMPSON AND FRANCIS COLUMBINE DATED IN  AND OF THOMAS ROWNEY DATED IN  WHILST THE BOOKPLATE OF GOSTLET HARINGTON OF MARSHFIELD IN THE COUN. OF GLOCESTER GENT.  IS UNIQUE THE MANTLING BEING CUT LIKE STRAWBERRY LEAVES. THERE IS A PECULIAR EFFECT PRODUCED BY THE WAY IN WHICH THIS EXAMPLE IS PRINTED AND THE LETTERING OF THE INSCRIPTION IS ALSO UNUSUAL.  THERE IS ONE OF THESE BOOKPLATES WHICH THE READER SHOULD NOTICE FROM THE PECULIAR ARRANGEMENT OF THE DECORATIVE ACCESSORIES OCCASIONED BY THE FACT THAT THE OWNER WAS BOTH A SPIRITUAL AND TEMPORAL PEER. I REFER TO THAT OF NATHANAEL CREWE LORD BISHOP OF DURHAM AND BARON CREWE OF STENE . HERE THE MANTLING SPRINGS FROM THE HELMET RISES TO THE LEVEL OF THE CREST AND TERMINATES AT THE HEADS OF THE SUPPORTERS A BARONS CORONET APPEARS INSTEAD OF A MITRE AND BEHIND THE SHIELD ARE A CROZIER AND SWORD IN SALTIRE THE DECORATION OF THE HEAD OF THE CROZIER BEING SO LIKE THE FORM OF THE MANTLING THAT IT SEEMS AT FIRST SIGHT TO BE PART OF IT.  THE JACOBEAN STYLE IS FAR MORE ORNATE THAN THAT LAST MENTIONED AND THE BOOKPLATE OF JOHN REILLY OF THE MIDDLE TEMPLE ESQR. IS A FAIR EXAMPLE OF THE BEST KIND OF JACOBEAN WORK. THE ESCUTCHEON IS RAISED ON AN ELABORATE AND RICHLYCARVED JACOBEAN SIDEBOARD MANTLING IS STILL THERE BUT IT IS CURTAILED AND SEEMS ALMOST RESTING ON THE TOP OF THE SIDEBOARD ON EITHER SIDE OF WHICH ARE COLUMNS GIVEN IN HIGH RELIEF ON EACH IS CARVED A PERPENDICULAR FESTOON OF LEAVES. BELOW THE SHIELD CROUCHED ON THE LEDGE OF THE SIDEBOARD ARE TWO EAGLES WITH EXPANDED WINGS EACH HOLDS IN ITS BEAK ONE END OF THE RIBBON WHICH TIES INTO A BUNCH THE CORNERS OF A FRINGED CLOTH BEARING THE INSCRIPTION ALREADY QUOTED BELOW THE EAGLES INVERTED CORNUCOPI POUR OUT BOOKS UPON THE FLOOR ON WHICH THE SIDEBOARD STANDS.  THIS PLATE MAY PROBABLY BE DATED VERY EARLY IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY OR EVEN LATE IN THE SEVENTEENTH SINCE IT IS RECORDED THAT JOHN REILLYS SIGNATURE WITH THE DATE  OCCURS IN A BOOK IN WHICH IT IS FASTENED. TO WHICHEVER DATE IT BELONGS THE SIMPLE ARMORIAL STYLE WAS THEN IN GENERAL USETHAT IS TO SAY SO FAR AS THE BOOKPLATES OF PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS ARE CONCERNED. THESE AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN NEARLY ALL BEAR A HELMET VARYING ACCORDING TO THE OWNERS SOCIAL RANK AND FROM THAT FALLS THE MANTLING MORE OR LESS ELABORATE. BUT IF WE LOOK AT THE BOOKPLATES DATED IN OR ABOUT THE YEAR  OF CERTAIN COLLEGES AT OXFORD OR CAMBRIDGE AT LADIES BOOKPLATES OF THE SAME PERIODNONE OF WHICH OF COURSE DISPLAY A HELMETAND AT SOME OTHERS IN WHICH THE ARMS ARE GIVEN IN AN OVAL WE SEE THAT THE BLANK ON EITHER SIDE OF THE SHIELD CONSEQUENT UPON THE ABSENCE OF THE HELMET FROM WHICH THE MANTLING WOULD FALL IS SUPPLIED BY WORK DISTINCTLY JACOBEAN. LORD DE TABLEY WHOSE DESCRIPTIONS IN JUSTIFICATION OF THE NAMES HE HAS BESTOWED UPON THE SEVERAL STYLES WE SHALL NOT HESITATE TO QUOTE IN THIS CHAPTER THUS DESCRIBES THIS WORK  TO SUPPLY THIS VOID IN DECORATION A DISTINCT FRAME WAS PLACED ROUND THE ESCUTCHEONS AND THIS FRAMEWORK WAS ORNAMENTED WITH RIBBONS PALM BRANCHES OR FESTOONS.  THE PROMINENT OR HIGHRELIEF PORTIONS OF THIS FRAME WERE NOT SET CLOSE TO THE EDGES OF THE ESCUTCHEONS BUT BETWEEN IT AND THEM AN INTERVAL OF FLATPATTERNED SURFACE NEARLY ALWAYS INTERVENED IN WHICH AS UPON A WALL THE ACTUAL SHIELD WAS EMBEDDED. THIS WE SHALL CALL THE LINING OF THE ARMORIAL FRAME AND WE SHALL FIND THIS LINING IS USUALLY IMBRICATED WITH A PATTERN OF FISHSCALES ONE UPON ANOTHER OR DIAPERED INTO LATTICEWORK. THE SCALECOVERED OR LATTICED INTERVAL OF LINING IS THE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE STYLE. . . . ANOTHER STEP IN THE EXTERNAL DECORATION WAS TO ADD A BRACKET DISTINCT FROM THE FRAME UPON WHICH THE SHIELD IN ITS FRAME WAS SUPPOSED TO REST. THIS BRACKET NATURALLY INITIATED THE DECORATIVE ART AND SURFACE ARRANGEMENT OF THE SHIELDFRAME.  AS A RULE TOO AN ESCALLOPSHELL FORMS THE CENTRE OF THE BRACKET IN JACOBEAN BOOKPLATES. IN SOME INSTANCES IT IS PLACED IN THE CENTRE BELOW BUT MORE USUALLY IN THE CENTRE ABOVE AND THEN IN THE CENTRE BELOW WE HAVE THE HEAD OF SOME MYTHICAL AND UNINVITING MONSTER. EITHER AS QUASISUPPORTERS ON THE LEDGES OF THE BRACKET RIGHT AND LEFT OR ON THE SIDE LEDGES OF THE SHIELD IF THE BRACKET IS AMALGAMATED WITH THE FRAME ARE THINGS SELECTED FROM THE FOLLOWING MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONLIONS CHERUBS MALE AND FEMALE TERMFIGURES BUSTS OF FAIRIES WITH BUTTERFLY WINGS ANGELS GENERALLY ENGAGED IN TRUMPETBLOWING ETC.  THE STUDENT SHOULD NOTICE THIS ESCALLOPSHELL BECAUSE WE SHALL SEE IT INTRODUCED INTO THE STYLE OF DECORATION THAT SUCCEEDED THE JACOBEANTHERE IT BECAME A SHELLY BORDER RATHER THAN A DISTINCT SHELL.  ON THE WHOLE THEN THE USUAL ORNAMENTATION OF A JACOBEAN BOOKPLATE RENDERS IT EASILY RECOGNISABLE. THE DECORATION IS STIFF AND CONVENTIONAL DISPLAYS MORE SOLIDITY THAN GRACE AND ALTOGETHER SEEMS LESS APPROPRIATE TO A BOOKPLATE THAN THE HEAVY ROLLS OF MANTLING WHICH AS WE HAVE SEEN SURROUNDED THE SHIELD DURING THE PREVALENCE OF THE PRECEDING STYLE. AS FOR THE TITLE JACOBEAN WHICH HAS BEEN BESTOWED UPON IT IT SHOULD BE EXPLAINED THAT THE REFERENCE IS RATHER TO THE STYLE OF DECORATION IN VOGUE IN THE DAYS OF JAMES II. THAN TO ANYTHING IN THE DAYS OF JAMES I. LORD DE TABLEY HAS POINTED OUT THAT AS COMPARED WITH THE WOODWORK PRESERVED IN CHURCHES OF THE LATTER HALF OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY AND AS COMPARED WITH THE MOULDINGS ON MONUMENTS OF THE SAME PERIOD A PRACTICAL IDENTITY OF DECORATION CANNOT FAIL TO STRIKE THE ANTIQUARY AND HIS CHOICE OF THE NAME JACOBEAN FOR THIS CLASS OF BOOKPLATES IS THUS ABUNDANTLY JUSTIFIED.  EXAMPLES OF JACOBEAN BOOKPLATES ARE NUMEROUS IN MOST ENGLISH COLLECTIONS FOR THE STYLE CONTINUED LONG IN FASHION INDEED IT LASTED IN MORE OR LESS PURITY DOWN TO  OR EVEN LATER AND I THINK IT QUITE LIKELY THAT SOME OF THE EVIDENTLY EARLY UNDATED EXAMPLES MAY REALLY HAVE BEEN EXECUTED DURING THE LAST QUARTER OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY. THE SIMILARITY TO WHICH WE HAVE JUST ALLUDED BETWEEN THE ORNAMENTATION SHOWN UPON JACOBEAN BOOKPLATES AND THAT DISPLAYED IN ECCLESIASTICAL DECORATION OF THE TIME OF CHARLES THE SECOND AS WELL AS JAMES THE SECOND MAKES IT VERY PROBABLE THAT THIS IS SO.  THE FEW BOOKPLATES WHICH ARE KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN DESIGNED OR EXECUTED BY HOGARTH SEE P.  ARE IN THE JACOBEAN STYLE BUT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THAT EMINENT ARTIST AND GEORGE VERTUE THE MEN WHO WORKED UPON JACOBEAN BOOKPLATES WERE NOT DISTINGUISHED ENGRAVERS. NEVERTHELESS SOME OF THEIR PRODUCTIONS ARE DISTINCTLY GOOD THOUGH THE DECORATION WAS PERHAPS TOO OFTEN OVERDONE. THE TOUCH IN MANY SUGGESTS THAT THE ARTIST WAS ACCUSTOMED TO ENGRAVE ON GOLD OR SILVER PLATE. THIS IS NOTABLY THE CASE IN THE BOOKPLATE OF CHARLES BARLOW ESQ. OF EMMANUEL COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE ENGRAVED IN OR IMMEDIATELY AFTER . THIS BOOKPLATE IS WORTHY OF OBSERVATION SHOULD THE READER MEET WITH IT AS A PARTICULARLY EXAGGERATED EXAMPLE OF THE JACOBEAN STYLE THE FRAMEWORK SEEMS SCARCELY ABLE TO SUPPORT THE DECORATIVE ACCESSORIES WITH WHICH IT IS LADEN AND WHICH INCLUDE REPRESENTATIONS OF BIRDS BEASTS MYTHICAL FIGURES STONY FLOWERS IN FESTOONS OR BASKETS HEADS SHELLS AND WHAT NOT  THE EARLIEST DATED JACOBEAN EXAMPLE IS THAT OF WILLIAM FITZ GERALD LORD BISHOP OF CLONFERT WHICH IS INSCRIBED . HERE THE ESCUTCHEON IS OF THE SIMPLE ARMORIAL SHAPE BUT SET IN A JACOBEAN FRAMEWORK DECORATED WITH LEAFY SPRAYS AND SURMOUNTED BY A MITRE THE RIBBONS OF WHICH TERMINATE IN TASSELS. NEXT WE HAVE THE BOOKPLATES OF FIVE CAMBRIDGE COLLEGESJESUS PEMBROKE QUEENS ST. JOHNS AND TRINITY HALL ALL BEAR THE SAME ENGRAVED DATE. THESE AND MANY LIKE THEM DATED IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS ARE NO DOUBT THE WORK OF ONE MAN THE DESIGN CONSISTS OF AN ESCUTCHEON ON WHICH ARE THE COLLEGE ARMS SET IN A FINELYDRAWN SCALEPATTERNED FRAME BEDECKED WITH HAWKBELLS RIBBONS WREATHS AND SPRAYS OF FLOWERS. OTHER COLLEGE PLATESEXCEPT THAT OF NEW COLLEGE OXFORD WHICH IS SIMPLE ARMORIAL IN ITS STYLEARE JACOBEAN.  IN  COMES THE BOOKPLATE OF DAME ANNA MARGARETTA MASON. HERE THE LOZENGE IN WHICH SHE BEARS HER ARMS APPEARS WITH DECORATION VERY SIMILAR TO THAT JUST DESCRIBED THOUGH SLIGHTLY MORE ELABORATE. IN  THE BOOKPLATE OF PHILIP LYNCH SHOWS HOW SIMILAR DECORATION IS BESTOWED UPON AN OVAL ESCUTCHEON WHILST IN  THE BOOKPLATE OF HENRY DUKE OF KENT FURNISHES AN EARLY DATED EXAMPLE OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THE BRACKET WHICH IS AS WE HAVE SEEN A LEADING FEATURE IN JACOBEAN ORNAMENTATION.  THIS IS REALLY A REMARKABLY FINE BOOKPLATE. THE ESCUTCHEON INDENTED IN A SOMEWHAT PECULIAR FASHION IS SURROUNDED BY THE GARTER AND FASTENED TO THE FRONT OF THE BRACKET A HIGHLY ORNAMENTED PIECE OF WORK ON WHICH STAND THE TWO SUPPORTERS. ABOVE IS THE DUCAL CORONET BELOW IN AN OBLONG JACOBEAN FRAME IS THE INSCRIPTION. THE FAMILY OF GREY DUKES OF KENT IS PROLIFIC IN BOOKPLATES THAT DATED FIVE YEARS LATER OF MARY COUNTESS OF HARROLD DAUGHTERINLAW TO HENRY DUKE OF KENT IS A MORE ELABORATE THOUGH LESS FINELY EXECUTED PIECE OF JACOBEAN WORK. HER ARMS AND THOSE OF HER HUSBAND APPEAR SIDE BY SIDE IN SEPARATE OVAL SHIELDS ANGELS HOLD ALOFT AN EARLS CORONET OVER BOTH WHILE BELOW BETWEEN THE SHIELDS IS THE HEAD OF A CHERUB WHOSE WINGS ARE ARRANGED AS A COLLAR.  OTHER CONSPICUOUS JACOBEAN BOOKPLATES ARE THOSE OF ELLERKER BRADSHAW DR. PHILIP BISSE BISHOP OF ST. DAVIDS RICHARD MASSIE OF CODDINGTON CHESHIRE JAMES HUSTLER  SIR THOMAS HARE BARONET OF STOW HALL IN NORFOLK DATED IN  SEE P.  FRANCIS WINNINGTON OF LINCOLNS INN ESQ. DATED IN  SAML. GOODFORD OF YE INNER TEMPLE ESQ. DATED IN  JOHN ROBINSON M.D. DATED IN  ST. THOMASS HOSPITAL LIBRARY AND LUCIUS HENRY HIBBINS OF GRAYS INNE ESQE.  A LITTLE BEFORE AND A LITTLE AFTER  THERE WAS A FASHION IN ENGLISH BOOKPLATES WHICH MAY ALMOST BE CALLED A STYLE IT WAS TO PLACE THE SHIELD OF ARMS IN A MEDALLION THE BACKGROUND OF WHICH IS SHADED. BENEATH IS THE OWNERS NAME AND DESCRIPTION. THE TERM TOMBSTONE STYLE MIGHT NOT SOUND AN AGREEABLE DESIGNATION FOR THESE BOOKPLATES BUT IT WOULD BE VERY ACCURATE FOR REALLY THERE IS A STRONG LIKENESS BETWEEN THEM AND THE MONUMENTAL SLABS PLACED OVER DECEASED PERSONS WHOSE SOCIAL STATUS RENDERED THEM ELIGIBLE FOR INTERMENT IN POSITIONS WHERE THEY WOULD BE WALKED OVER BY FUTURE GENERATIONS OF CHURCHGOERS. WE MAY MENTION THREE SUCH BOOKPLATES EDWARD HAISTWELL DATED IN  SIR JOHN RUSHOUT AND JOHN LETHIEULLIER REMEMBRANCER OF THE CITY.  SO FAR THE SHAPE OF THE SHIELD USED HAS BEEN PERFECTLY SYMMETRICAL. WE NOW COME TO SPEAK OF THE THIRD STYLE ADOPTED BY ENGLISH BOOKPLATE DESIGNERS THE LEADING FEATURE OF WHICH IS AN ABSENCE OF SYMMETRY. THIS STYLE HAS BEEN CHRISTENED CHIPPENDALE AND WHEN ITS CHARACTERISTICS HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED AND THE LEADING FEATURES IN CHIPPENDALE FURNITURE REMEMBERED WE SHALL SEE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE NAME.  THE MARK AND STAMP OF A CHIPPENDALE EX LIBRIS SAYS LORD DE TABLEY IS A FRILLING OR BORDER OF OPEN SHELLWORK SET CLOSE UP TO THE ROUNDED OUTER MARGIN OF THE ESCUTCHEON AND WITH BREAKS MORE OR LESS ENCLOSING IT. THIS SEEMS TO BE A MODIFICATION OF THE SCALLOP SHELL SO NORMAL AT THE BASE EITHER OF FRAME OR BRACKET ON A JACOBEAN PLATE. IT IS IN FACT A BORDER IMITATING THE PECTINATED CURVES AND GROOVES ON THE MARGINS OF A SCALLOPSHELL. OUTSIDE THIS SUCCEED VARIOUS FURNITURELIKE LIMBS AND FLOURISHES EMINENTLY RESEMBLING THE TRIUMPHS OF ORNATE UPHOLSTERY WHICH CHIPPENDALE ABOUT THIS TIME BROUGHT INTO VOGUE. THE HELMET AND MANTLING ARE QUITE EXCEPTIONAL IN BOOKPLATES OF THIS STYLE EXCEPT IN EXAMPLES WHICH WERE PROBABLY DESIGNED AND EXECUTED BY SCOTCH ARTISTS.  ILLUSTRATION  ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT UNTIL  THAT CHIPPENDALE PUBLISHED IN FOLIO THE GENTLEMANS AND CABINETMAKERS DIRECTOR BEING A LARGE COLLECTION OF THE MOST USEFUL DESIGNS OF HOUSEHOLD FURNITURE IN THE MOST FASHIONABLE TASTE WITH  PLATES OF ELEGANT DESIGNED FURNITURE THERE WAS PROBABLY BY THAT TIME A GOOD DEAL OF CHIPPENDALE FURNITURE ALREADY IN THE MARKET AND WE ARE THEREFORE NOT SURPRISED TO FIND A BOOKPLATE DESIGNED IN THE CHIPPENDALE STYLE DATED IN THAT OF EAST APTHORPE. TRUE THE STYLE THERE SHOWN IS NOT AT ALL ADVANCED YET THERE ARE DECIDED INDICATIONS OF IT AND FOR THAT REASON IT DESERVES ATTENTION. ALTHOUGH THE SHIELD IS SHELLSHAPED AND ORNAMENTED WITH FLOWERS YET THERE ARE UPON THE PLATE INDICATIONS OF A HORIZONTALLYHATCHED JACOBEAN LINING TO THE FRAME. WE MAY I THINK CONSIDER THIS ONE OF THE EARLIEST ATTEMPTS AT DESIGNING A CHIPPENDALE BOOKPLATE.  ILLUSTRATION  THE STYLE IMPROVED DURING THE NEXT TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS AND THEN BEGAN TO DETERIORATE. AS AN ESCUTCHEON THE SHELLSHAPED OR NONSYMMETRICAL SHIELD IS UNNATURAL AND EVEN UGLY BUT IT LENDS ITSELF TO AN ARTISTIC TREATMENT WHICH THE PREVIOUS STYLES IN ENGLISH BOOKPLATES CERTAINLY DID NOT. FOR EXAMPLE FLOWERSOF WHICH THERE ARE ALWAYS MANY IN THIS STYLE OF BOOKPLATECAN BE REPRESENTED AS IN NATURE ROSES BLOSSOM ON SPRAYS OR BRANCHES INSTEAD OF BEING WOVEN CLOSELY TOGETHER IN CONVENTIONAL FESTOONS LILIES ARE LEFT TO DROOP THEIR HEADS WHILST BUNCHES OF GRASSES OR LEAVES ARE BOUND SO LOOSELY TOGETHER THAT THEY FORFEIT NOTHING OF THEIR NATURAL ELEGANCE. ALLEGORIC FIGURES ALSO FIND PLACE IN CHIPPENDALE BOOKPLATES BUT THEY ARE OF A MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE KIND THAN THOSE DISPLAYED IN THE JACOBEAN PLATES. CUPIDS OR NYMPHS ARE SOMETIMES REALLY GRACEFUL BITS OF DRAWING WHEN DEPICTED IN THE BETTER SPECIMENS OF THE STYLE OF WHICH WE ARE NOW SPEAKING. THE BOOKPLATE OF JAMES BRACKSTONE CITIZEN OF LONDON DATED IN FIGURED OPPOSITE THIS PAGEIS AS GOOD A SPECIMEN OF A PURE CHIPPENDALE BOOKPLATE AS COULD BE FOUND WHILST THAT OF JOHN ORD OF LINCOLN INN DATED TEN YEARS LATER BETRAYS SOME SIGNS OF A DECADENCE WHICH SOON AFTERWARDS BECAME GENERAL.  THE FASHION AS LORD DE TABLEY REMARKS BEGAN TO BE VULGARISED IN THE HANDS OF WEAK DESIGNERS WHO BESTOWED FLORAL EMBELLISHMENTS UPON THE FRAMEWORK OF THE SHIELDS WITHOUT ANY MODERATION WHATEVER ENDEAVOURING BY A CROWDED DECORATION TO MASK THE REAL WEAKNESS AND POVERTY OF THEIR POWERS OF DESIGN. AS A CONSEQUENCE WE HAVE IN THE LATER CHIPPENDALE BOOKPLATES THOSE SAY FROM  TO  OR  SOME VERY TERRIBLE PRODUCTIONS. SHELLWORK AND FLOWERS ARE RETAINED BUT THEY ARE REGARDED AS INADEQUATE AND CHERUBS DRAGONS NYMPHS IN KILTED PETTICOATS SHEEP CATTLE TREES FRUIT FRUITBASKETS PORTIONS OF BUILDINGS FOUNTAINS BOOKS IMPLEMENTS OF HUSBANDRY AND A HOST OF OTHER MISCELLANEOUS OBJECTS APPEAR AS DECORATIONS. INDEED IT IS WONDERFUL WHAT A STRANGE MEDLEY A DESIGNER IN THE LATER DAYS OF CHIPPENDALEISM COULD PRODUCE FOR A CUSTOMER WILLING TO PAY FOR IT  WE MAY AS WELL HERE POINT OUT A FEW INTERESTING EXAMPLES OF ENGLISH BOOKPLATES DESIGNED IN THE CHIPPENDALE STYLE. A PROLIFIC WORKER IN IT WAS J. SKINNER OF BATH SEE PP.   WHO FOLLOWED THE EXCELLENT PLAN OF DATING NEARLY ALL HIS WORK WHICH SHOULD THEREFORE BE CAREFULLY OBSERVED WHEN MET WITH. IN ONE OF HIS BOOKPLATES THAT WHICH IN  HE PRODUCED FOR CHARLES DELAFAYE ESQ. OF WICHBURY WILTS. IT IS CURIOUS TO NOTE WITH WHAT EVIDENT DIFFIDENCE THE DESIGNER USES THE GRACEFUL SPRAYS OF NATURAL FLOWERS IN ORNAMENTING THE SHELLY SHIELD. YET IN ANOTHER BOOKPLATE THAT OF BENJAMIN HATLEY FOOTE ENGRAVED IN THE SAME YEAR THE ANONYMOUS ARTIST USES THESE ORNAMENTS WITHOUT HESITATION AND PRODUCES A BOOKPLATE WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN ENGRAVED MANY YEARS LATER. TWO VERY NOTICEABLE EXAMPLES ARE ALSO SUPPLIED BY THE FULLY DEVELOPED CHIPPENDALE BOOKPLATES OF RICHARD CARYER AND JOSEPH POCKLINGTON. IN EACH THE CREST IS PLACED ON A MINIATURE REPRESENTATION OF THE SHIELD WHICH CONTAINS THE ARMS. OF THE DEBASED CHIPPENDALE BOOKPLATES OF WHICH WE HAVE HAD TO SPEAK IT IS HARD TO SELECT EXAMPLES FOR PARTICULAR REFERENCE FOR THEY ARE SADLY NUMEROUS AND SEEM TO VIE WITH EACH OTHER IN UGLINESS AND VULGARITY THE PRIZE MAY HOWEVER BE CLAIMED BY C. EVE WHO CONSCIOUS PERHAPS OF THE ATROCITY HE WAS COMMITTING IN USING SUCH A BOOKPLATE MAKES AN ATTEMPT AT DISGUISING HIS NAME. TO DESCRIBE HIS PLATE IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT BUILT ON TO THE FRAME ARE SUNDRY STAGES ON WHICH A VARIETY OF PASTORAL SCENES ARE DEPICTED AND THAT ANY BEAUTIES WHICH THE FLORAL EMBELLISHMENTS MIGHT IN THEMSELVES POSSESS ARE EFFECTUALLY OBLITERATED BY OVERCROWDING.  BEFORE CHIPPENDALEISM HAD DIED OUT ANOTHER MARKED STYLE IN ENGLISH BOOKPLATES HAD ALREADY COME IN AND WAS GETTING TO BE GENERALLY ADOPTED. WE WILL CALL THIS THE WREATH AND RIBBON OR FESTOON STYLE AND PROBABLY ONE OF THE EARLIEST EXAMPLES OF IT IS THAT FIGURED OPPOSITE WHICH SHOWS US THE BOOKPLATE OF GEORGE LEWIS JONES BISHOP OF KILMORE DATED IN . THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF GRACE IN THESE WREATH AND RIBBON BOOKPLATES. THE SHIELD IS AGAIN SYMMETRICAL AND OF A SHAPE THAT A SHIELD MIGHT POSSIBLY BE THE FLOWERS AND LEAVES THAT DECORATE IT ARE FOR THE MOST PART STILL LEFT FREE AND UNCONFINED AND EVEN WHEN WOVEN INTO FESTOONS THEY ARE SOMEWHAT LESS CONVENTIONAL THAN THOSE WHICH COMPOSE THE FESTOONS OF THE JACOBEAN PERIOD. THESE FESTOONS AND A LABYRINTH OF FLOATING RIBBONS WERE INTENDED TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LOSS OF THE SHELLY BORDER AND ITS ADJUNCTS OF THE CHIPPENDALE STYLE.  JUST IN THE SAME WAY AS THE CHIPPENDALE BOOKPLATES VERY CLOSELY RESEMBLED IN THEIR DECORATION THE FURNITURE WITH WHICH CHIPPENDALE FILLED THE FASHIONABLE DRAWINGROOMS OF HIS TIME SO IN THEIR TURN THOSE DESIGNED IN WHAT WE HAVE CHRISTENED THE WREATH AND RIBBON STYLE VERY CLOSELY RESEMBLED THE DECORATION WHICH THOMAS SHERATON SUGGESTED FOR CONTEMPORARY FURNITURE. THIS THE READER MAY SEE FOR HIMSELF IF HE WILL TURN TO SHERATONS WORK THE CABINETMAKER AND UPHOLSTERERS DRAWING BOOK.  ILLUSTRATION  I DO NOT KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES OF THE WREATH AND RIBBON BOOKPLATES WHICH CALL FOR SPECIAL ATTENTION. THOUGH SEVERAL ARE PRETTY THERE IS A STRONG FAMILY LIKENESS BETWEEN ALL. PERHAPS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS IS THAT OF JOHN SYMONS ESQR. IN THIS PRETTILY DRAWN CHERUBS DESCENDING FROM THE SKY HOLD THE CORNERS OF A MANTLE WHICH SURROUNDS THE SHIELD. THE BOOKPLATES OF SIR THOMAS BANKS IANSON OF CORFE CASTLE DORSET OF THE REV. GEORGE POLLEN AND OF JOHN HOLCOMBE NEW CROSS ARE USEFUL FOR COMPARISON ON ACCOUNT OF THE ENGRAVED DATES WHICH THEY BEAR  AND  RESPECTIVELY WHILST THAT OF ROBERT SURTEES MAINSFORTH IS INTERESTING BOTH FROM ITS POSSESSOR THE HISTORIAN OF DURHAM WHO WAS ALSO ITS DESIGNER AND FROM ITS UNUSUAL HATCHED BACKGROUND.  BY DEGREES THE FESTOONS OF FLOWERS AND ENTANGLEMENT OF RIBBONS WERE DISCARDED AND THE SHIELD SIMILARLY SHAPED APPEARED DESTITUTE OF ORNAMENTATION. THE HELMET WAS OMITTED AND THE WREATH ON WHICH THE CREST SHOULD PROPERLY REST WAS PLACED IN A MEANINGLESS WAY THE FRACTION OF AN INCH ABOVE THE UPPER LINE OF THE SHIELD AND ENTIRELY WITHOUT SUPPORT. AFTER THIS QUITE EARLY IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND DURING ITS FIRST FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS THERE CAME INTO FASHION A DESIGN IN ENGLISH BOOKPLATES WHICH WE MAY TERM THE CELESTIAL STYLE. IN THIS THE SHIELD IS DEPICTED AS SUSPENDED IN MIDAIR WITH A BACKGROUND OF SKY OR CLOUDS OR ELSE RESTING UPON A CLOUDBUILT BANK. IT GAVE THE DESIGNER VERY SLIGHT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE DISPLAY OF ARTISTIC TASTE HAD IT DONE SO THE OPPORTUNITY WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED FOR THE DESIGNERS AND ENGRAVERS OF BOOKPLATES IN THIS STYLE WERE MEN OF WHOM THE WORLD AT LARGE KNOWS NOTHING. THE SHIELD IN BOOKPLATES OF THE TIME OF WHICH I AM NOW SPEAKING WAS ENTIRELY WITHOUT ORNAMENT AND OF THIS SHAPE  ILLUSTRATION  THE HELMET WAS SELDOM INTRODUCED SO THAT THE CREST WAS PLACED IN THE SAME ABSURD POSITION AS THAT JUST DESCRIBED. THE SHIELD FIGURED ABOVE IS A FAIR SPECIMEN OF THAT IN VOGUE BETWEEN  AND . FROM THE LATTER DATE TO WITHIN A FEW YEARS AGO THE ARMS IN THE MAJORITY OF ENGLISH BOOKPLATES WERE REPRESENTED IN A MORE ORNATE SHIELD. THE HELMET WAS REINTRODUCED AND FROM IT FELL A SLIGHT MANTLING SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH APPEARS IN OUR EARLIEST EXAMPLES. IT IS HARDLY NECESSARY TO INDICATE ANY PARTICULAR SPECIMENS DESIGNED IN THESE LASTMENTIONED STYLES.  BEFORE CLOSING THIS CHAPTER I OUGHT PERHAPS TO SAY A WORD ABOUT SCOTCH AND IRISH BOOKPLATES. IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT IN THESE THERE WAS EVER A STYLE DISTINCTIVELY NATIONAL. THE STYLE FASHIONABLE IN ENGLAND AT A PARTICULAR TIME WAS ALSO FASHIONABLE IN SCOTLAND AND IN IRELAND YET THERE IS A PERCEPTIBLE DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY IN WHICH ITS DETAILS WERE CARRIED OUT ESPECIALLY IN SCOTLAND. IN EDINBURGH THERE WERE SEVERAL BOOKPLATE ENGRAVERS AND THEIR WORK POSSESSES A CHARACTERISTIC TOUCH THE SIMPLE ARMORIAL STYLE IS RENDERED MUCH MORE STIFFLY AND THE SHIELD IS OFTEN ROUND. JACOBEAN BOOKPLATES ARE VERY UNCOMMON BUT THE CHIPPENDALES ARE AN ODD MIXTURE OF THAT STYLE AS WE KNOW IT IN ENGLAND AND THE JACOBEAN. THE PRESENCE OF A HELMET AND MANTLING IN A CHIPPENDALE BOOKPLATE ENGRAVED IN SCOTLAND IS NOT UNUSUAL AND THE SHIELD IS ALWAYS VERY SOBERLY PLACED. I DO NOT KNOW OF A LIBRARY INTERIOR PLATE THAT HAILS FROM NORTH OF THE TWEED BUT IF ONE EVER BE DISCOVERED DEPEND UPON IT NO CUPIDS WILL FROLIC THERE. A FEW SCOTCH BOOKPLATES ARE PERHAPS EMBLEMATIC THAT IS DISPLAY EMBLEMS OF THE POSSESSORS ART OR TRADE. DR. JOHN BOSWORTHS IN WHICH ARE FIGURED THE STAFF OF SCULAPIUS A COCK A SERPENT AND AN OWL IS AN INSTANCE OF THIS BUT ALLEGORY IS ALMOST UNKNOWN. NO MYTHOLOGICAL FIGURES SIT AMONG THE FLORAL DECORATIONS OF SCOTCH CHIPPENDALE BOOKPLATES AS THEY DO SO FREQUENTLY IN LATER CHIPPENDALE WORK IN ENGLAND. THE ONLY INSTANCE THAT I CAN CALL TO MIND OF THE INTRODUCTION OF FIGURES AT ALL INTO THE DECORATION OF A SCOTCH BOOKPLATE IS THAT OF BIRNIE OF BROOMHILL CIRCA  REPRODUCED OPPOSITE AND IN THIS THE FIGURES ARE SOMBRE ENOUGHTWO MINISTERS OF THE KIRK KNEELING AT THEIR DESKS. IRISH BOOKPLATES HAVE EVEN LESS INDIVIDUALITY THAN SCOTCH AND ARE CHIEFLY RECOGNISABLE BY THE COARSENESS OF THEIR WORK AND THEIR DARK PRINTING.  ILLUSTRATION  FOOTNOTE   A LIST OF SOME SCOTTISH BOOKPLATE ENGRAVERS COMPILED BY MR. J. ORR IS PRINTED IN THE EX LIBRIS JOURNAL II. P. .     CHAPTER IV  ALLEGORY IN ENGLISH BOOKPLATES   IN THE LAST CHAPTER I SPOKE OF THE LEADING STYLES FOLLOWED IN DESIGNING ENGLISH BOOKPLATES IN AS FAR AS POSSIBLE CHRONOLOGICAL SEQUENCE THOUGH THE READER WILL HAVE NOTICED THAT SUCH STYLES OVERLAPPED EACH OTHER OFTEN BY A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF YEARS. CONCURRENTLY WITH THESE DISTINCT STYLES OR WITH NEARLY ALL OF THEM THERE ARE TO BE FOUND MANY ENGLISH BOOKPLATES WHICH MAY BE APPROPRIATELY CALLED PICTURE BOOKPLATES AND WHICH MAY THEMSELVES BE DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THOSE WHICH QUITE APART FROM THE HERALDRY UPON THEM SHOW THINGS UNREAL OR COMBINATIONS OF THINGS REAL AND UNREAL AND THOSE WHICH APART FROM THE HERALDRY SHOW THINGS WHOLLY REAL. LET US SPEAK FIRST OF THE FORMER OF THESE DIVISIONSALLEGORIC BOOKPLATES WE WILL CALL THEM.  THE COLLECTOR WILL SOON DISCOVER THAT IN ENGLAND ALLEGORY FORMED AT NO PERIOD EXCEPT PERHAPS IN THE DAYS OF BARTOLOZZI AND SHERWIN A REALLY NATIONAL STYLE IN BOOKPLATES BUT RATHER AN OCCASIONAL FANCY INDULGED IN BY A PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL HERE AND THERE. WHILST IN FRANCE BOOKPLATES ON WHICH WAS DISPLAYED ALLEGORY AND THE WILDEST ALLEGORY WERE ACTUALLY ABUNDANT IN ENGLAND THEY ARE DECIDEDLY RARE AND IT IS INDEED INTERESTING TO SEE HOW OUR ENGLISH ARTISTS SET TO WORK WHEN CALLED UPON TO DESIGN THEM.  SO FAR AS I AM AWARE THE EARLIEST EXAMPLE OF AN ENGLISH ALLEGORIC BOOKPLATE AS YET BROUGHT TO LIGHT IS THAT OF THOMAS GORE OF ALDERTON WHICH IS FULLY DESCRIBED ON P. . THIS MAY BE DATED SOMEWHERE ABOUT  AND WAS AS THE SIGNATURE SHOWS US THE WORK OF A DUTCH ARTIST MICHAEL BURGHERS SO THAT WE MAY PERHAPS REGARD THE ALLEGORY UPON IT RATHER AS THE OUTCOME OF MICHAELS BRAIN THAN THE CARRYING OUT OF INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN HIM BY A WILTSHIRE SQUIRE  THE DATE OF THE NEXT ENGLISH BOOKPLATE I HAVE NOTICED IN WHICH ALLEGORY IS INTRODUCED IS ALSO THE WORK OF A FOREIGNERA FRENCHMANLOUIS DU GUERNIER WHO AT THE AGE OF THIRTY CAME OVER FROM PARIS IN  AND WHO DIED HERE IN . SOON AFTER HIS ARRIVAL HE EXECUTED A BOOKPLATE DECIDEDLY FOREIGN IN APPEARANCE FOR LADY CAIRNES WIFE OF SIR ALEXANDER CAIRNES OF MONAGHAN. THE CAIRNES ARMS IMPALING GOULD ARE ON A ROUND SHIELD IN A SCALY FRAME THIS IS PLACED ON STEPS AT THE BACK OF WHICH IS CLASSICAL MASONRY. THE SHIELD IS KEPT FROM FALLING BY THREE CUPIDSTWO SEATED AND ONE STANDINGWHILST TWO FLYING ONES HOLD ALOFT A RIBBON BEARING THE OWNERS NAME THUS LADY ELIZABETH CAIRNES. SHE WAS A SISTER OF SIR NATHANIEL GOULD SO THAT HER DESCRIPTION ON THE BOOKPLATE AS LADY IS CLEARLY WRONG SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED DAME. THE ERROR AROSE MOST LIKELY FROM THE ENGRAVERS IMPERFECT KNOWLEDGE OF ENGLISH TITLESA VERY GENERAL STUMBLINGBLOCK TO FOREIGNERS. THE BOOKPLATE IS AN EXCEEDINGLY PRETTY PIECE OF WORK. THERE IS SOME OF THE JACOBEAN SCALE WORK USED IN IT WHICH ENGLISH ENGRAVERS WERE BEGINNING TO INTRODUCE INTO THEIR DESIGNS BUT THE EMPLOYMENT OF ALLEGORY IS CERTAINLY THE MOST STRIKING FEATURE IT POSSESSES. I DO NOT KNOW OF ANY OTHER BOOKPLATES EXECUTED BY LOUIS DU GUERNIER WHILE IN ENGLAND AND PROBABLY THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY WERE NOT YET QUITE PREPARED TO CONFIDEAS LORD DE TABLEY PUTS ITTHEIR FAMILY ESCUTCHEONS TO THE CARE OF MINERVA OR THE DELIAN PHOEBUS HIMSELF.  BUT THOUGH MICHAEL BURGHERSS SOMEWHAT UNBEAUTIFUL ALLEGORY MAY NOT HAVE PLEASED THOMAS GORE OR HIS OTHER ENGLISH CLIENTS IN  NOR THE PRETTIER ALLEGORY OF LOUIS DU GUERNIER HAVE GENERALLY COMMENDED ITSELF TO PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY IN  ALLEGORY IF NOT IN THE WORK OF THESE ARTISTS WAS BOUND SOONER OR LATER TO COME INTO FASHION ON ENGLISH BOOKPLATES SEEING THAT IT WAS AND FOR LONG HAD BEEN FASHIONABLE ACROSS THE CHANNEL. THERE HAVE BEEN FEW OUTBREAKS OF DISEASE ON THE CONTINENT THAT HAVE NOT INFECTED THIS COUNTRYAT ALL EVENTS SLIGHTLY. THE FOREIGNERS WHOM THE FOREIGN KING ON HIS ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND IN  BROUGHT WITH HIM ENGENDERED FOREIGN WAYS AND FOREIGN FASHIONS AT COURT AND THESE WAYS AND FASHIONS WERE IN TURN ADOPTED BY PEOPLE WHO DID NOT GO TO COURT AND THAT IS HOW ALLEGORY CREPT INTO THE BOOKPLATES OF THE RANK AND FILE OF ENGLISHMEN.  THE FIRST ENGLISH ENGRAVER BORN AND BRED TO EXECUTE AN ALLEGORIC BOOKPLATE WAS JOHN PINE HIMSELF A MAN OF LETTERS AND ONE WITH WHOSE FEATURES HOGARTH HAS MADE US FAMILIAR. IN  HE WAS EMPLOYED TO DESIGN AND ENGRAVE A BOOKPLATE TO PLACE IN THE THIRTY THOUSAND VOLUMES OF BISHOP MOORES LIBRARY WHICH GEORGE I. HAD BOUGHT IN  TO PRESENT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE BUT WHICH WERE NOT SUITABLY HOUSED TILL . NO DOUBT PINE WAS FULLY IMPRESSED WITH THE MUNIFICENCE OF THE GIFTA MASS OF VOLUMES WHICH THE HEAVYHEADED KING WOULD HAVE NEVER OPENED HAD HE KEPT AND NEVER UNDERSTOOD HAD HE OPENED THEM. HIS TASK WAS TO DESIGN A BOOKPLATE COMMENSURATE WITH THE ROYAL MUNIFICENCE AND HE PROBABLY CONSIDERED HE HAD BEEN EQUAL TO THE OCCASION WHEN HE PRODUCED WHAT WE SEE OPPOSITE THE NEXT PAGE. LORD DE TABLEYS WORDS SO ACCURATELY DESCRIBE THIS POMPOUS PRODUCTION THAT I WILL QUOTE THEM  THE DESIGN REPRESENTS A VAST STRUCTURE RATHER LIKE AN ORMOLU CHIMNEYPIECE CLOCK OF WHICH THE ARMS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE IN A PLAIN SOLID FRAME REPRESENT THE FACE. BEHIND THIS TOWERS UP A VAST PYRAMID ON WHICH THE BRICK WORK IS DISTINCTLY MARKED. AS DEXTER SUPPORTER STANDS PHOEBUS APOLLO IN PERSON REACHING OUT A WREATH. A CLOUDED SUN RAYS OUT BEHIND HIM. AT HIS FEET ARE DEPOSITED SAMPLES OF THE BOOK COLLECTION OF LATE SO MUNIFICENTLY BESTOWED. AS SINISTER SUPPORTER SITS MINERVA WITH HELM AND SPEAR AND GORGONHEADED SHIELD. HER FEET ARE WRAPT IN CLOUD. IN THE CENTRE OF THE BRACKET BENEATH THESE GODS IS INSERTED A MEDALLION PORTRAIT OF ROYAL GEORGE READING ROUND ITS EXERGUE GEORGIUS D.G. MAG. BR. FR. ET HIB. REX F.D. THIS IS FLANKED BY A LAUREL AND A PALM BRANCH. PINEWHO HAD SUBMITTED PROOFS OF THIS BOOKPLATE BEFORE AUGUST  FOR AT THAT DATE HE OFFERS TO MAKE GEORGES PORTRAIT MORE ACCURATEENGRAVED FOUR SIZES OF THIS PLATE. THE DESIGN IS SIMILAR IN THREE BUT IN THE FOURTH AND SMALLEST THE ARTIST EVIDENTLY FELT THAT IN SO LIMITED A SPACE HE COULD NOT DO JUSTICE TO APOLLO AND MINERVA AND DISCREETLY OMITTED THEM. HE SIGNS THIS SMALLEST PLATE IN FULL J. PINE SCULP.  THERE MAY NOW BE SEEN AT CAMBRIDGE IN MANY OF THE BOOKS WHICH GEORGE I. PRESENTED BOOKPLATES WHICH AT FIRST SIGHT APPEAR TO BE MODERN IMPRESSIONS FROM PINES PLATES BUT ON EXAMINATION PROVE TO BE COPIES THOUGH NOT EXACT COPIES OF PINES WORK AND ON THESE THE SIGNATURE IS J. B. THE LATE MR. HENRY BRADSHAW DISCOVERED THAT THESE COPIES WERE THE WORK OF JOHN BALDREY A CAMBRIDGE ENGRAVER AT THE CLOSE OF THE LAST CENTURY. AT THE TIME THAT HE WAS WORKING FOR THE UNIVERSITY A LARGE NUMBER OF THE VOLUMES GIVEN BY GEORGE I. REQUIRED REBINDING AND AS PINES PLATES WERE WORN OUT OR LOST BALDREY WAS COMMISSIONED TO EXECUTE A COPY OF THE EARLIER DESIGN IN ORDER TO SUPPLY A BOOKPLATE FOR THE REBOUND VOLUMES.  ILLUSTRATION BOOKPLATE FOUND IN BOOKS GIVEN BY GEORGE I. TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE.  VERY SOON AFTER THE MUNIFICENTIA REGIA TO CAMBRIDGE IN  THE LOYALTY OF OXFORD TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS HOUSE OF HANOVER WAS SERIOUSLY DOUBTED AND THE KING SENT A SQUADRON OF HORSE INTO THE CITY WHEREUPON AN OXFORD VARSITY WIT COMPOSED THE FOLLOWING EPIGRAM      THE KING OBSERVING WITH JUDICIOUS EYES      THE STATE OF BOTH HIS UNIVERSITIES      TO ONE HE SENDS A REGIMENTFOR WHY      THAT LEARNED BODY WANTED LOYALTY      TO TH OTHER BOOKS HE GAVE AS WELL DISCERNING      HOW MUCH THAT LOYAL BODY WANTED LEARNING.  WHICH DREW FROM A CHAMPION OF CAMBRIDGE THE REPLY      THE KING TO OXFORD SENT HIS TROOP OF HORSE      FOR TORIES OWN NO ARGUMENT BUT FORCE      WITH EQUAL CARE TO CAMBRIDGE BOOKS HE SENT      FOR WHIGS ALLOW NO FORCE BUT ARGUMENT.  THOUGH MUCH LATER IN DATE THAN THE DESIGN JUST NOTICED IT MAY BE AS WELL TO MENTION HERE ANOTHER BOOKPLATEALSO ALLEGORICWHICH WAS ENGRAVED BY JOHN PINE. THIS WAS EXECUTED BY HIM FROM A DRAWING BY GRAVELOT FOR DR. JOHN BURTON ABOUT THE YEAR . IT SHOWS US THE INTERIOR OF A LIBRARY PRESUMABLY THE DOCTORS WITH A COUPLE OF CUPIDS SUPPORTING A SHIELD BEARING THE BURTON ARMS. THIS DESIGN WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY APPROPRIATED BY WADHAM WYNDHAM ESQ. AS HIS BOOKPLATE IS A VERY SLIGHT AFFAIR AFTER THE CAMBRIDGE PLATE BUT PINE NO DOUBT POSSESSED A FITTING SENSE OF THE DIFFERENCE TO BE OBSERVED IN DESIGNING A BOOKPLATE FOR A MERE DOCTOR OF DIVINITY AND IN COMMEMORATING THE GIFT OF A ROYAL DONOR.  AFTER JOHN PINE THE NEXT DESIGNERS OF ENGLISH BOOKPLATES IN THE ALLEGORIC STYLE ARE BOTH FAMOUS MENWILLIAM HOGARTH AND GEORGE VERTUE. WE WILL SPEAK OF THE WORKS OF THE GREATER MAN FIRST THEY CONSIST OF TWO UNDOUBTED BOOKPLATES AND OF A FEW MORE POSSIBLE ONES AND WERE EXECUTED QUITE AT THE OUTSET OF HOGARTHS CAREER SAY ABOUT . THE FIRST IS DESCRIBED AS DONE FOR THE BOOKS OF JOHN HOLLAND HERALD PAINTER. MINERVA IS SEEN SEATED AMONG CUPIDS FOUR IN NUMBER WITH HER HAND PLACED UPON A SHIELD BEARING THE FAMILY ARMS. THE CHIEF INTEREST IN HOGARTHS OTHER UNDOUBTED BOOKPLATETHAT OF GEORGE LAMBART THE LANDSCAPE PAINTER ONE OF HOGARTHS CONVIVIAL CREWLIES IN THE FEMALE FIGURES WHICH SIT RIGHT AND LEFT OF THE SHIELD. IT IS FIGURED OVER LEAF FROM THE COPY IN SIR WOLLASTON FRANKSS COLLECTION WHICH IS THE ONLY ORIGINAL EXAMPLE KNOWN TO EXISTOTHER COPIES ARE FROM THE PLATES IN IRELANDS WORK AND BEAR HIS INITIALS. THE COLLECTOR IS CAUTIONED AGAINST CERTAIN PLATES SIGNED W. H. WHICH HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO HOGARTH BUT ARE IN REALITY THE WORK OF WILLIAM HIBBART A BATH ENGRAVER WORKING ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.  ILLUSTRATION  TURNING NOW TO THE WORK OF GEORGE VERTUE IN DESIGNING ENGLISH ALLEGORIC BOOKPLATES WE COME TO A VERY BEAUTIFUL AND VERY INTERESTING EXAMPLE WHICH WAS PROBABLY ENGRAVED IN OR VERY SOON AFTER THE BOOKPLATE OF HENRIETTA COUNTESS OF OXFORD. I HAVE ALREADY CALLED ATTENTION TO THIS ENGRAVING IN SPEAKING OF OLDTIME ALLUSIONS TO BOOKPLATES P.  AND DO NOT HERE INTEND TO DO MORE THAN MAKE PASSING REFERENCE TO IT SINCE I HAVE SPOKEN FULLY OF IT LATER ON IN WHAT I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT LADIES BOOKPLATES PP. . IT IS ONLY MENTIONED NOW IN ORDER TO GIVE A REFERENCE TO IT IN ITS PROPER CHRONOLOGICAL POSITION.  WE HAVE NOW TO TRAVEL FOR SOME DISTANCE ALONG THE ROAD OF TIME BEFORE COMING TO ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF ALLEGORY ON AN ENGLISH BOOKPLATE.  WE FIND IT IN  ON A PLATE WHICH ONE J. SKINNER ENGRAVED FROM A DESIGN BY T. ROSS. THIS IS REALLY A VERY BEAUTIFUL BOOKPLATE AS ITS REPRODUCTION P.  SHOWS. A SHIELDTHE SHAPE AND ORNAMENTATION OF WHICH IS CHIPPENDALEBEARING THE WILTSHIRE ARMS IS PLACED UPON A PLATFORM AND AGAINST A CIPPUS OR SMALL MONUMENTAL COLUMN SHAKESPEARE STANDS ON THE RIGHT AND LISTENS WITH A PLEASED EXPRESSION TO THE MUSIC OF A RUSTIC PIPER WHOSE HEAD APPEARS AT THE BACK OF THE CIPPUS WHILST ON THE LEFT POPE WEIGHS THE ELOQUENCE OF AN ORATOR WHOSE HEAD AND UPRAISED HAND ALSO APPEAR FROM BEHIND THE CIPPUS. A MEDALLION OF AUGUSTUS IS ON A PEDESTAL ABOVE. LYING ON THE PLATFORM ARE A GLOBE AND BOOKS AND MANY EMBLEMS OF THE PAINTERS AND MUSICIANS ARTS AND AMONGST THESE SITS CUPID THINKING PERHAPS WITH WHICH HE WILL PLAY NEXT AND HOLDING THE END OF A RIBBON INSCRIBED JOHN WILTSHIRE BATH . THE DESIGN IS CERTAINLY ORIGINAL AND MAKES US INTERESTED AS TO THE IDENTITY OF THE OWNER.  IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT WE HAVE HERE NOT ONLY AN INTERESTING BOOKPLATE BUT THE BOOKPLATE OF AN INTERESTING MAN. WHEN GAINSBOROUGH THE PAINTER MOVED TO BATH IN  HE FOUND THAT THE PICKFORD OF THE DAY WHO HAD THE CARRYING TRADE OF THE BATH ROAD WAS NO ORDINARY CARRIER BUT A MAN OF TASTE AND CULTURE AND READY TO DO ANYTHING HE COULD TO HELP ART AND ARTISTS. HE WAS A CERTAIN JOHN WILTSHIRE AND BEFORE GAINSBOROUGH HAD BEEN LONG A RESIDENT AT BATH HE WAS WILTSHIRES FAST FRIEND AND IN THE ENJOYMENT OF A VERY TANGIBLE PROOF OF FRIENDSHIP FOR WILTSHIRE CARRIED TO LONDON GRATIS EVERY PICTURE THAT GAINSBOROUGH NEEDED TO SEND THITHER. NOT A PENNY WOULD HE TAKE FOR CARRIAGE. NO NO HE WOULD SAY WHEN THE PAINTERS MODESTY LED HIM TO PROTEST AGAINST SUCH GENEROSITY I ADMIRE PAINTING TOO MUCH FOR THAT. NO DOUBT HE DID AND IT MUST BE SAID THAT IN RETURN FOR HIS GOODNESS GAINSBOROUGH GAVE HIM MANY A CHARMING BIT OF WORK ON WHICH TO FEAST HIS EYES. LET US HOPE WE HAVE BEFORE US THE BOOKPLATE OF THIS KIND OF WORTHY MAN AS ALLAN CUNNINGHAM CALLED HIM WHO LOVED GAINSBOROUGH AND ADMIRED HIS WORKS.  ILLUSTRATION  OF COURSE THE PLATE IS TWENTY YEARS EARLIER THAN THE COMMENCEMENT OF GAINSBOROUGHS RESIDENCE AT BATH AND OF HIS FRIENDSHIP WITH WILTSHIRE BUT WHAT OF THAT WILTSHIRE HAD BEEN LIKELY ENOUGH A LOVER OF THINGS BEAUTIFUL AND THE OWNER OF BOOKS LONG BEFORE THERE IS NO NECESSITY FOR IMAGINING THAT HIS WAS A SUDDEN CONVERSION TO A SELFSACRIFICING LOVE FOR ART PRODUCED BY INTIMACY WITH GAINSBOROUGH.  ANOTHER INTERESTING ENGLISH BOOKPLATE IN WHICH ALLEGORY PLAYS A PART IS THAT ALSO BY J. SKINNER OF WILLIAM OLIVER DOCTOR OF MEDICINE PHILANTHROPIST AND INVENTOR OF BISCUITS. IT IS JUDGING FROM THE FORM OF THE ENGRAVERS SIGNATURE OF ABOUT THE SAME DATE AS THE WILTSHIRE BOOKPLATE. THE SHIELD BEARING THE OLIVER COATOFARMS RESTS UPON A PLATFORM ON WHICH STAND TWO FIGURES AS IN THE EXAMPLE LAST DESCRIBED BUT INSTEAD OF THESE FIGURES BEING REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DRAMA AND OF LITERATURE THEY ARE AN ANCIENT AND A MODERN MEDICAL PRACTITIONER THE FORMER PERHAPS EVEN THE GOD OF MEDICINE HIMSELF. THIS WAS QUITE APPROPRIATE FOR OLIVER THOUGH A MAN OF CULTURED TASTES IN VARIED WALKS OF LIFE AND ONE WHO MIGHT HAVE APPROPRIATELY COMMITTED THE CARE OF HIS FAMILY ESCUTCHEON TO THE ALLEGORIC REPRESENTATIVES OF MANY ARTS WAS FIRST AND FOREMOST A DOCTOR OF MEDICINE. THE MODERN DOCTOR IS ARRAYED IN CAP AND GOWN AND STANDS ON THE LEFT OF THE SHIELD WITH HAND OUTSTRETCHED TOWARDS HIS FELLOW OF OLD TIME. BELOW THE PLATFORM ON A TRIANGLE IS A CLUB AROUND WHICH THE SERPENT OF SCULAPIUS ENTWINES ITSELF.  ILLUSTRATION  OLIVERS LIFE LASTED FOR HARD ON SEVENTY YEARS TO  AFTER SETTLING AT BATH AND COMMENCING PRACTICE HIS RISE TO FAME WAS REMARKABLE FOR ITS RAPIDITY AND AS QUITE EARLY IN HIS CAREER HE BUSIED HIMSELF WITH HOSPITAL BUILDING HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT AND OTHER GOOD WORKS HE SOON MADE FOR HIMSELF A NUMBER OF ENEMIES AMONGST HIS FELLOWPRACTITIONERS LESS CAPABLE AND LESS ENERGETIC THAN HIMSELF. AS A PHYSICIAN AND PHILANTHROPIST HE IS NOW FORGOTTEN AS THE INVENTOR OF A BISCUIT HE IS REMEMBEREDFOR THE BATH OLIVER STILL HOLDS ITS OWN AGAINST THE MULTITUDE OF MODERN COMPETITORS AND IS STILLSO THE MAKERS SAYPREPARED FROM DR. OLIVERS ORIGINAL RECEIPT. THAT RECEIPT HE CONFIDED WHEN ON HIS DEATHBED TO HIS COACHMAN GIVING HIM  IN MONEY AND TEN SACKS OF THE FINEST FLOUR WHEREWITH TO CONTINUE THE PRODUCTION OF THE THEN ALREADY POPULAR BISCUITS. WITH THE MONEY THE COACHMAN OPENED A SHOP IN GREEN STREET BATH AND SO GOT TOGETHER A COMFORTABLE FORTUNE. OF SKINNER TO WHOM WE OWE THESE TWO PLATES WE SHALL HAVE MORE TO SAY PRESENTLY PP.  IN REFERRING TO THE ENGRAVERS OF ENGLISH BOOKPLATES.  TEN YEARS AFTER THE WILTSHIRE PLATE COMES OUR NEXT DISTINCTLY ALLEGORIC BOOKPLATE ENGRAVED BY A SECONDRATE ENGRAVER FOR JOHN DUICK. I HAVE NOT SEEN THIS PLATE BUT LORD DE TABLEY WHOSE WORDPICTURES ARE ALWAYS GOOD THUS DESCRIBES ITAPOLLO WITH A BROAD RAY EFFECT ROUND HIS HEAD PLAYING THE LYRE TO THE NINE MUSES WHO ARE GROUPED AROUND HIM THE MUSICAL ONES ALSO ASSIST IN THE CONCERT WITH VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS. BELOW ARE CLOUDS ABOVE THEM APPEAR THE ABRUPT CLIFFS OF HELICON WITH PEGASUS LAUNCHING HIMSELF INTO THE AIR THEREFROM THE FOUNTAIN HIPPOCRENE TAPPED BY HIS GALLOPING HOOFS DESCENDS THE CLIFFSIDE IN A CASCADE.  ALLEGORY ALSO APPEARS IN THE TWO BOOKPLATES ENGRAVED BY SIR ROBERT STRANGE ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THOSE OF HIS BROTHERINLAW ANDREW LUMISDEN SECRETARY TO PRINCE CHARLIE AND OF A DR. THOMAS DRUMMOND. THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THE FORMER WAS ENGRAVED HAVE BEEN ALREADY REFERRED TO P. . IT IS A SOMBRE BOOKPLATE SHOWING US BEFORE A DARK BACKGROUND A SLAB WITH A BUST AT EITHER END CUPID PLAYS ON THE GROUND BEFORE THE CENTRE OF THE SLAB THE LUMISDEN ARMS ARE ON A SHIELD THAT LIES IN THE LEFTHAND CORNER AND A HEAVY CURTAIN HANGS OVER THE UPPER PART OF THE DESIGN WHICH IS SIGNED R. STRANGE SCULPT.  DR. DRUMMONDS BOOKPLATE SEE P.  IS A LESS HEAVY BUT NOT SO FINISHED A PRODUCTION AND IS DRAWN BY T. WALE AURORA SOARS AT THE TOP OF THE DESIGN AND WITH HER LEFT HAND PULLS ASIDE A CURTAIN THUS DISCLOSING A VIEW OF THE DOCTORS LIBRARY. IN THE CENTRE IS PLACED A TABLE COVERED WITH CLOTH EXCEPT AT THE RIGHTHAND CORNER HERE THE DRAPERY IS RAISED SO AS TO DISPLAY THE ORNATE WORKMANSHIP OF THE TABLELEG. ON THE CLOTH ARE A NUMBER OF BOOKS SOME MUSIC AND A FLUTE BEFORE THE TABLE A GLOBE AND LEANING AGAINST THAT A VIOLONCELLO. THE GENERAL DECORATION OF THE ROOM IS CLASSICAL AND BUSTS AND STATUES ARE INTRODUCED THOUGH NOT WITH SUFFICIENT DETAIL TO BE RECOGNISABLE. IN AURORAS RIGHT HAND IS A FLAMING TORCH HELD IN DANGEROUS PROXIMITY TO THE CURTAIN.  AFTER THE DATE OF THESE TWO PLATES COMES ANOTHER LONG INTERVALTWENTY YEARS OR SOBEFORE WE REACH THE NEXT TRULY ALLEGORIC BOOKPLATE DESIGNED IN ENGLAND. WE THEN FIND A DECIDEDLY GRACEFUL PIECE OF WORK. A HOODED SIBYL SEATED AT THE FOOT OF A PYRAMID PERUSES ATTENTIVELY AN OPEN VOLUME. SHE LEANS HER CHEEK UPON HER RIGHT HAND WHILST THE LEFT RESTS UPON THE BOOK. A CADUCEUS AGAINST WHICH RESTS A SHIELD OF ARMS LIES AT HER FEET. THE WHOLE IS CONTAINED IN AN OVAL WREATH OF BERRIED LAUREL. BELOW IS WRITTEN E LIBRIS JOHIS CURRER DE KILDWICK ARM. THIS BOOKPLATE WAS AFTERWARDS ALTERED FOR DANSON RICHARDSON CURRER DE GLEDSTON ARM AND AN INFERIOR COPY WAS USED BY A CERTAIN R. H. ALEXANDER BENNET THIS IS A MUCH COMMONER BOOKPLATE THAN THE CURRERIN EITHER FORM.  ILLUSTRATION  OF MUCH THE SAME DATE IS THE FAR LESS GRACEFUL REPRESENTATION OF ALLEGORY WHICH APPEARS ON THE BOOKPLATE OF T. GASCOIGNE PARLINGTON IN YORKSHIRE. HERE WE HAVE A REPRESENTATION OF WHAT WE MUST PRESUME IS THE INTERIOR OF THE PARLINGTON LIBRARY BUT NEITHER T. GASCOIGNE NOR YET ANY OTHER EIGHTEENTH CENTURY YORKSHIRE GENTLEMAN IS TASTING THE SWEETS OF HIS LITERARY COLLECTION THE LIBRARY IS TENANTED BY A COUPLE OF MYTHOLOGICAL FEMALES OF SUCH SUBSTANTIAL FORMS THAT LORD DE TABLEY THINKS THEY MUST REPRESENT TWO YORKSHIRE DAMSELS MASQUERADING ONE AS A MUSE AND THE OTHER AS APOLLO. THE MUSE WRITES DOWN EITHER NOTES OR WORDS FROM APOLLOS DICTATION. COLUMNS SUPPORT THE ROOF OF THE LIBRARY AND IN A NICHE IN THE WALL STANDS A SMALL STATUE OF MINERVA. IF MR. GASCOIGNE OBTAINED THE SERVICES OF SOME YORKSHIRE RELATIVES TO STAND AS MODELS FOR THE FIGURES ON HIS BOOKPLATE HE PROBABLY DID SO WHEN THEY WERE IN TOWN FOR THE SEASON FOR THE WORK IS SIGNED BY A BOND STREET ENGRAVER.  ABOUT THE YEAR  ENGLISH ALLEGORIC BOOKPLATES BECAME MORE NUMEROUS AND THE ALLEGORY UPON THEM ASSUMES A GRACE IN CONCEPTION AND EXECUTION NOT BEFORE KNOWN. CIPRIANI BARTOLOZZI AND HIS PUPIL SHERWIN WERE SHOWING ENGLISHMEN HOW ALLEGORY COULD BE REPRESENTED ON BOOKPLATES WITHOUT BEING CLUMSY AND RIDICULOUS AND THE LESSER ARTISTS WERE IMITATING THEIR WORK WITH MORE OR LESS SUCCESS.  ONE OF BARTOLOZZIS EARLIEST BOOKPLATES WAS EXECUTED FOR SIR FOSTER CUNLIFFE BART. THE DESCENDANT OF A VERY FAMOUS LIVERPOOL MERCHANT. THE CUNLIFFE ARMS APPEAR IN MIDAIR RESTING UPON A BANK OF CLOUDS TWO EXQUISITELY DRAWN CHERUBS SUPPORT THE SHIELD OVER WHICH IS FOLDED DRAPERY. THE CHERUB ON THE DEXTER SIDE IS SEATED AND HOLDS A CADUCEUS IN HIS RIGHT HAND. THE ONE ON THE SINISTER SIDE IS FURNISHED WITH TWO TRUMPETS AND IS BLOWING THAT IN HIS LEFT HAND. ON A MEDALLION ABOVE THE SHIELD IS THE CUNLIFFE CREST WITH THE MOTTO FIDELITER. THE PLATE WHICH WAS AFTERWARDS ALTERED FOR SIR ROBERT H. CUNLIFFE BART. IS IN ALL PROBABILITY CIPRIANIS DESIGN FOR THAT ARTIST SIGNS HIS NAME AS DESIGNER OF AN ALMOST SIMILAR BOOKPLATE FOR JEAN TOMMINS WHICH WAS ENGRAVED BY FORD SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE. A VERY COARSE IMITATION OF THE DESIGN WAS ALSO USED BY THOMAS ANSON OF SHUGHBOROUGH WHO INTRUSTED THE IMITATION TO YATES.  SIR FOSTER CUNLIFFE WAS A GRANDSON OF FOSTER CUNLIFFE KING CHARLES THE SECONDS GODSON THE LIVERPOOL MERCHANT WHO ACCORDING TO FOSTERS LANCASHIRE FAMILIES BECAME NOT ONLY THE FIRST MAN IN LIVERPOOL BUT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A MORE EXTENDED COMMERCE THAN ANY MERCHANT IN THE KINGDOM AND DECLINED ALL SOLICITATIONS THAT HE SHOULD REPRESENT LIVERPOOL IN PARLIAMENT.  THE REMARKABLY LARGE EXAMPLE OF BARTOLOZZIS WORK WHICH HAS OFTEN BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE BOOKPLATE OF GEORGE III. DOES NOT APPEAR EVER TO HAVE BEEN USED AS SUCH. IN THE PREVIOUS EDITION OF THIS BOOK I ALLUDED TO IT AT P.  AS POSSIBLY A GIFT TO THE KING IN WHICH AT THE EXPENSE OF UTILITY BARTOLOZZI SOUGHT TO DISPLAY HIS GRATITUDE TO AND ADMIRATION FOR THE SOVEREIGN UNDER WHOM HE HAD COME TO RESIDE IT DOES NOT HOWEVER SEEM THAT BARTOLOZZI INTENDED THE ENGRAVING FOR A BOOKPLATE AT ALL BUT DESIGNED IT FOR THE TITLEPAGE OF A FOLIO VOLUME ISSUED IN  WHICH CONTAINED ENGRAVINGS OF THIRTYSIX STATESMEN OF THE REIGN OF HENRY VIII. FROM DRAWINGS BY HOLBEIN. I WILL GIVE A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE ENGRAVING IN QUESTION SO THAT IT MAY BE MORE EASILY RECOGNISED BY THE COLLECTOR IF OFFERED TO HIM AS A BOOKPLATE. IT SHOWS US THE ARMS OF ENGLAND AS BORNE BY GEORGE III. PRIOR TO THE UNION WITH IRELAND UPHELD IN MIDAIR BY THREE INHABITANTS OF THE SKIES. ABOVE THE SHIELD A FOURTH CELESTIAL BEING IS FLYING AND AT THE SAME TIME HOLDING ALOFT HIS MAJESTYS CROWN. ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE PLATE IS THE FIGURE OF FAME WHO ON A LONG TRUMPET PLACED TO HER LIPS IS EVIDENTLY GIVING A SONOROUS BLAST. THIS IS PERHAPS THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE PART OF THE DESIGN FOR THE WHOLE WEIGHT OF THIS SOMEWHAT MASSIVE YOUNG LADY IS UPON THE SHIELD WHICH WE HAVE SAID IS IN MIDAIR AND ONLY SUPPORTED BY THREE CHERUBS WHOSE UNITED MUSCULAR POWERS STRIKE ONE AS TOTALLY INADEQUATE TO BEAR THE BURDEN IMPOSED UPON THEM.  ILLUSTRATION  IN  BARTOLOZZI THEN A ROYAL ACADEMICIAN EXECUTED HIS MOST BEAUTIFUL BOOKPLATE. IT IS INSCRIBED H. F. BESSBOROUGH AND WAS MADE FOR LADY HENRIETTA FRANCES SPENCER WHO IN  MARRIED FREDERICK THIRD EARL OF BESSBOROUGH. THE DESIGN SHOWS US A ROMAN INTERIOR WITH AN EXQUISITELY DRAWN VENUS SEATED AND HOLDING IN HER LEFT HANDWHICH IS UPLIFTEDA BURNING HUMAN HEART AND IN HER RIGHT A DOVE. BEHIND HER IS A VASE OF FLOWERS. THE OTHER INMATES OF THE ROOM ARE TWO CUPIDS WHO HOLD ABOVE THE GODDESS A LONG SCARF BEARING LADY BESSBOROUGHS NAME. THE DESIGN IS CIPRIANIS. BESIDES HIS SIGNATURE AND THAT OF THE ENGRAVER THERE IS ALSO ON THE BOOKPLATE PUBLISHED DEC.   BY F. BARTOLOZZI. IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT IN  HOGARTH BY HIS OWN EXERTIONS ON BEHALF OF HIS BROTHER ARTISTS MANAGED TO GET AN ACT THROUGH PARLIAMENTA BODY THAT THEN PROBABLY CARED LITTLE FOR ART OR ARTISTSBY WHICH DESIGNERS AND ENGRAVERS OBTAINED A COPYRIGHT IN THEIR OWN WORKS AND IT IS A SINGULAR TESTIMONY TO THE POPULARITY OF BARTOLOZZIS WORK THAT ON SO TRIVIAL A WORK AS A BOOKPLATE IT WAS FOUND NECESSARY TO ADOPT THIS FORMULA OF PUBLICATION. BY THE KINDNESS OF THE HON. GERALD PONSONBY I AM ENABLED TO STATE THAT BARTOLOZZIS RECEIPT FOR THIS TICKET PLATE AS HE CALLS IT BEARS AS ITS DATE THE TH DECEMBER  THE DAY BEFORE THE DATE OF PUBLICATION. IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT BARTOLOZZI RECEIVED  FOR HIS WORK. THE BOOKPLATE IS GIVEN ON THE PREVIOUS PAGE.  QUITE DISTINCT FROM THIS JOYOUS BOOKPLATE IS ANOTHER EXECUTED BY THE SAME ARTIST FOR A SPANISH LADY WHICH WE MAY CLASS AS ENGLISH SINCE IT WAS NO DOUBT ENGRAVED BY HIM IN ENGLAND. ISABEL DE MENEZES THE LADY FOR WHOM THIS BOOKPLATE WAS DESIGNED WAS AS SHE TELLS US ON IT IN THE SEVENTYFIRST YEAR OF HER AGE. ALLEGORIC FIGURES DISPORTING THEMSELVES IN YOUTHFUL FROLIC WOULD PERHAPS HAVE BEEN OUT OF KEEPING ON THE BOOKPLATE OF A LADY AT THAT SOMBRE TIME OF LIFE AND SO THE DESIGNER HAS RUN TO THE OTHER EXTREME. GLOOMINESS PREDOMINATES IN THIS BOOKPLATE. A PARTLY RUINED SQUAREBUILT TOMB IS ERECTED ON A PROMONTORY ABOVE THE SEA BRIARS AND OTHER CREEPERS HAVE GROWN ROUND IT AND HAD COVERED IT TILL THE KNEELING FEMALE FIGURE DREW THEM DOWN IN ORDER TO PLACE UPON THE TOMB A COMMEMORATIVE INSCRIPTION. BESIDE THE FIGURE IS A CUPID WHO POINTS TO THE NEWLYCUT WORDS. IT HAS BEEN THOUGHT THAT THIS MAY HAVE BEEN DESIGNED FOR A VISITING CARD IT IS QUITE IN THE FASHION OF SUCH THINGS AT THE DATE AND IT IS LIKELY ENOUGH THAT ISABEL DE MENEZES USED THE PLATE BOTH AS A CARD AND AS A MARK OF OWNERSHIP FOR HER BOOKS.  THERE ARE BESIDES THOSE DESCRIBED A NUMBER OF ENGLISH BOOKPLATES WHICH IN STYLE MUCH RESEMBLE BARTOLOZZIS WORK. IF THEY ARE HIS THEY PROBABLY DATE BEFORE  FOR THE ADOPTION OF THE PUBLICATION FORMULA BEFORE NOTICED MAKES IT IMPROBABLE THAT HE EXECUTED ANY WORK WHILST IN ENGLAND THAT HE DID NOT THUS PROTECT. AFTER HIS DEPARTURE FROM THIS COUNTRY HE PRODUCED FROM A DRAWING BY SIGNEIRA A BOOKPLATE FOR SIR THOMAS GAGE BART. OF HENGRAVE HALL SUFFOLK. IN THIS A FEMALE FIGURE SITS UPON A STONE AGAINST WHICH IS A PLAIN SHIELD BEARING THE GAGE ARMS. THE PLATE IS SIGNED BARTOLOZZI LISBON . THERE IS A DISTINCT RESEMBLANCE IN THIS BOOKPLATE TO THAT WHICH WAS ENGRAVED EITHER IN  OR  FOR RICHARD HOARE ELDEST SON OF THE LORD MAYOR OF LONDON. HE WAS CREATED A BARONET IN THE FORMER YEAR AND DIED IN THE LATTER. IN THIS WE HAVE A SEATED FEMALE CLASSICALLY DRAPED WHO RESTS HER LEFT ELBOW ON A CIPPUS ON WHICH IS ENGRAVED A SHIELD BEARING THE ARMS OF HOARE. RICHARD HOARE MARRIED THE HEIRESS OF STOURHEAD AND HIS SON WAS SIR RICHARD COLT HOARE THE FAMOUS ANTIQUARY AND AUTHOR. THE DATE AT WHICH THIS PLATE MUST HAVE BEEN EXECUTED  OR  DOES NOT ALLOW THE ABSENCE OF THE ENGRAVERS NAME AND FORMULA OF PUBLICATION TO TELL AGAINST THE WORK BEING BARTOLOZZIS HIS FAME WAS NOT THEN SO GREAT AND HE FOUND IT LESS NECESSARY TO PROTECT HIS ENGRAVINGS FROM PIRACY SEE P. .  BEAUTIFUL AS ARE BARTOLOZZIS BOOKPLATES IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT HIS CAPABILITIES AS A DESIGNER OR AN ENGRAVER ARE DEMONSTRATED IN THESE WORKS OF A LARGER KIND SHOWED FORTH HIS TALENTS FAR MORE.  SO THEN ALLEGORY AT LENGTH CAME TO BE ALMOST POPULAR WITH ENGLISH BOOKPLATE OWNERS AND VARIOUS LESSER ARTISTSHENSHAW ROE POLLARD AND SOME OTHERSPRODUCED IT IN IMITATION OF BARTOLOZZI WITH ONLY INDIFFERENT SUCCESS. BUT BEFORE ENDING THIS CHAPTER WE MUST SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE BOOKPLATE WORK OF BARTOLOZZIS CHIEF ENGLISH PUPIL JOHN KEYS SHERWIN. IN  THE YEAR AFTER HE GAINED THE ROYAL ACADEMYS GOLD MEDAL FOR DRAWING HE EXECUTED AN EXTREMELY PRETTY ALLEGORIC BOOKPLATE FOR JOHN MITFORD OF PITTS HILL. IT REPRESENTS AN INFANT NEPTUNE WITH HIS TRIDENT SEATED ON A LARGE SHELL WHICH IS UPON THE BACK OF A SEAHORSE. YOUNG NEPTUNES DRAPERY FORMS A GRACEFUL CANOPY AND HE SUPPORTS IN HIS RIGHT HAND A SMALL SHELL WHICH DISPLAYS THE MITFORD ARMS AND CREST. A DOLPHIN SPOUTING WATER IN FOUNTAINLIKE SPRAYS SWIMS BY HIS SIDE. THERE ARE TWO STATES OF THIS PLATE ONE HAVING THE ARMS INCORRECTLY SHADED BOTH ARE SIGNED BY SHERWIN.  IN CLOSING OUR REMARKS ON ENGLISH BOOKPLATES DESIGNED AFTER THIS FASHION NOTICETHOUGH ONLY A PASSING ONE FOR IT IS SPOKEN OF FULLY LATER ONMUST BE TAKEN OF THE CHARMING BOOKPLATE WHICH AGNES BERRY DESIGNED IN  FOR HER FRIEND MRS. DAMER. I MENTION IT HERE ONLY TO ASSOCIATE IT IN THE READERS MIND WITH ALLEGORIC BOOKPLATES.  SO MUCH FOR ALLEGORY ON ENGLISH BOOKPLATES. IT IS TO THE CREDIT OF ENGLISHMEN THAT ALLEGORIC WORK DID NOT BECOME POPULAR UNTIL SOMETHING REALLY ARTISTIC IN THIS PARTICULAR STYLE WAS PRODUCED AND THAT EVEN BEFORE THAT TIME ALLEGORY NEVER RAN QUITE SO WILD ON ENGLISH BOOKPLATES AS IT DID ON FOREIGN EXAMPLES. M. POULET MALASSIS ASSURES US THAT INTO ONE FRENCH BOOKPLATE OF THE LAST CENTURY WERE CROWDED THE WHOLE PERSONNEL OF OLYMPUS  FOOTNOTES   THE DESIGN HAS BEEN MORE RECENTLY USED BY THOMAS GAINSFORD.   WILLIAM OLIVERS PLATE FROM BIBLIOGRAPHICA VOL. II. P. .     CHAPTER V  ENGLISH PICTURE BOOKPLATES   IN TURNING NOW TO CONSIDER ENGLISH BOOKPLATES WHICH SHOW US APART FROM THE HERALDRY UPON THEM THINGS WHOLLY REAL WE FIND MUCH THAT IS INTERESTING. FIRST WE HAVE PORTRAIT BOOKPLATES THOSE WHICH EITHER COMBINED WITH HERALDRY OR ENTIRELY WITHOUT IT SHOW US THE FEATURES OF THE OWNER OF THE VOLUME. THERE ARE BUT FEW OF SUCH BOOKPLATES BUT THEY ARE SO INTERESTING THAT WE SHALL SPEAK OF THEM BY THEMSELVES LATER ON PP.  THEY ARE COMMON TO ALL PERIODS AND THE FASHION OF USING THEM HAS INCREASED LATELY.  THEN WE HAVE BOOKPLATES IN WHICH BOOKS THEMSELVESBOOK PILES OR BOOK SHELVESARE THE PREDOMINATING FEATURE IN THE DESIGN WITH THESE SIR ARTHUR VICARS IN THE PAGES OF THE EX LIBRIS JOURNAL HAS DEALT EXHAUSTIVELY. THOUGH THE BOOKPLATES WHICH SHOW US LIBRARY INTERIORS WOULD SEEM NATURALLY TO COME INTO THIS CLASS OF EXAMPLES I HAVE BEEN FORCED TO EXCEPT THE MAJORITY OF THEM AND TO SPEAK OF THEM IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER AS BEING IN NEARLY EVERY CASE AT LEAST TINGED WITH ALLEGORY. EVEN IN THE SANCTUM OF A DOCTOR OF DIVINITY CUPID FROLICS ABOUT AS HAPPY AND AS BUSY AS IN A MAIDENS BOUDOIR. STILL THERE ARE A FEW LIBRARY INTERIORS ENTIRELY FREE FROM ALLEGORY. TAKE FOR INSTANCE THE BOOKPLATE OF SIR ROBERT CUNLIFFE. HERE WE HAVE THE INTERIOR OF A LIBRARY WITH A WINDOW TO THE RIGHT. EVERY ORNAMENT IS THOROUGHLY CHIPPENDALE IN CHARACTER THE LEGS OF THE TABLE THE CARTOUCHE WHICH CONTAINS THE NAME THE SHIELD AND THE WOODWORK SURROUNDING THE WINDOW. ON THE TABLE IS A GLOBE UPON A STAND THE SUPPORTS OF WHICH TERMINATE IN CHIPPENDALE SCROLLS AN INKSTAND WITH A PEN ON IT AND TWO BOOKS ONE CLOSED AND THE OTHER OPEN. THERE ARE NUMBERS OF BOOKS CONFUSEDLY DISPOSED ON THE SHELVES THE CEILING OF THE ROOM IS PLAIN AND THERE IS ONLY A PLAIN LINE FOR A CORNICE. THE ARMS OCCUPY THE CENTRE OF THE PLATE AND APPEAR TO BE SUSPENDED IN MIDAIR THE FOOT OF ONE OF THE SCROLLS ONLY RESTING ON THE TABLE.  AGAIN THE BOOKPLATES OF THE MANCHESTER SUBSCRIPTION LIBRARY THE MANCHESTER CIRCULATING LIBRARY AND THE ROCHDALE CIRCULATING LIBRARY ALL SHOW INTERIORS OF LIBRARIES BUT FREE FROM ALLEGORIC INMATES. THESE THREE BOOKPLATES ARE NEARLY IDENTICAL. THERE ARE SHELVES OF BOOKS AT THE SIDES A TILED FLOOR A TABLE IN THE FOREGROUND A PANELLED CEILING WITH A CORNICE AND AT THE END OF THE ROOM PERHAPS A PASSAGE. THERE IS A ROUND ARCH CONTAINING A WINDOW OF THREE LIGHTS THE CENTRE ONE HAVING A ROUND TOP. THE GENERAL APPEARANCE OF THE ROOM IS CLASSICAL VERY SIMILAR IS THE BOOKPLATE OF THE LIVERPOOL LIBRARY. HERE WE HAVE A COMPLICATED CHIPPENDALE BOOKCASE WITH TEN COLUMNS UPON SQUARE BASES AND ORNAMENTAL CAPITALS OF NO PARTICULAR STYLE. THE SHELVES ARE FILLED WITH BOOKS AND THE TWO CENTRAL DIVISIONS OF THE BOOKCASE ARE ALL CUPBOARDS. IN THE CENTRE OF THE CASE AMONG CHIPPENDALE SCROLLS IS THE CREST OF THE TOWN AND BELOW THE CENTRAL DIVISION OF THE BOOKCASE ARE THE WORDS LIVERPOOL LIBRARY IN TWO LINES. BELOW THE WHOLE IS A LARGE CARTOUCHE IN THE SAME STYLE AS THE REST OF THE PLATE INSCRIBED ALLOWED FOR READING . . . . DAYS. FORFEITURE . . . D. PER DAY. MR. J. PAUL RYLANDS IN HIS INTERESTING NOTES ON BOOKPLATES TELLS US THAT THIS LIBRARY NOW THE LYCEUM WAS FOUNDED ON THE ST OF MAY  THE BOOKPLATE WAS NO DOUBT ENGRAVED SOON AFTERWARDS AS ALL THE ORNAMENTATION INTRODUCED IS CERTAINLY CHIPPENDALE. SO TOO IS THAT ON THE BOOKPLATE ENGRAVED BY JOHN PINE IN  WHICH THE BENCHERS OF GRAYS INN USED FOR THEIR VOLUMES. HERE A SHELLSHAPED SHIELD BEARING THE ARMS OF THE LEARNED AND HONOURABLE SOCIETY IS APPARENTLY FASTENED ON TO A BACKGROUND OF BOOKSHELVES FILLED WITH BOOKS. SO MUCH FOR THE LIBRARY INTERIORS. THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE VOLUMES IN THE OTHER BOOKPLATES IN WHICH BOOKS FORM THE CHIEF FEATURE OF DECORATION IS GENERALLY LIKE THAT SHOWN OPPOSITE IN THE BOOKPLATE OF WILLIAM HEWER A COMMISSIONER OF THE NAVY AND THE FRIEND AND SECRETARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS. HOW THE SCROLL ON WHICH ARE EITHER THE OWNERS ARMS OR HIS NAME IS SUPPORTED IS NOT CLEAR.  ILLUSTRATION  THE BOOKPLATE OF SIR PHILIP SYDENHAM DATED  WHEN HE WAS AS HE TELLS US TWENTYTHREE YEARS OF AGE OFFERS ANOTHER INTERESTING EXAMPLE OF THE BOOKPILE DESIGN SIR PHILIP SHOWS US HIS COAT OF ARMS ON THE FACE OF THE SCROLL ON THE LOWER ROLL OF WHICH IN VERY SMALL LETTERS IS WRITTEN THE INSCRIPTION. APPARENTLY NEITHER THIS NOR ANY OF HIS OTHER BOOKPLATES COMPLETELY SATISFIED HIM FOR DURING THE REMAINING FORTY YEARS OF HIS LIFE HE HAD MORE THAN HALFADOZEN DIFFERENT PLATES DESIGNED AND NEARLY ALL OF THESE ARE FOUND IN VARIOUS STATES. THERE ARE MR. FINCHAM TELLS ME SOME SIXTEEN VARIETIES OF SIR PHILIPS BOOKPLATE MANY OF HIS BOOKS ARE NOW IN SION COLLEGE LIBRARY. IN THE BOOKPLATE OF WHITE KENNETT WHO FILLED THE SEE OF PETERBOROUGH FROM  TO  WE SEE HOW THE EMBLEMS OF EPISCOPACY ARE TREATED WHEN INTRODUCED INTO BOOKPLATES OF THIS TYPE. WHITE KENNETT HAD OTHER BOOKPLATES THE RAREST AND EARLIEST ENGRAVED WHEN HE WAS AT COLLEGE IS IN THE SIMPLE ARMORIAL STYLE. THESE BOOKPILE PLATES APPEAR AT INTERVALS DOWN TO THE CLOSE OF THE CENTURY AND THE STYLE HAS BEEN RECENTLY REVIVED BY BOOKPLATE DESIGNERS IT IS SIMPLE AND CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE. THE APPROXIMATE DATE OF EACH EXAMPLE MAY BE GENERALLY GATHERED FROM THE SHAPE OF THE SHIELD CONTAINING THE ARMS OR THE STYLE OF DECORATION AROUND IT.  WE HAVE YET TO SPEAK OF BY FAR THE MOST NUMEROUS CLASS OF THOSE ENGLISH BOOKPLATES WHICH MAY BE PROPERLY BROUGHT INTO OUR SECOND DIVISION OF PICTURE BOOKPLATESI MEAN THE EXAMPLES WHICH REPRESENT UPON THEM A LANDSCAPE EITHER REAL OR IMAGINARY. THE REAL LANDSCAPES REPRESENTED HAVE OF COURSE SOME DIRECT REFERENCE TO THE PLATE BEING A VIEW EITHER OF THE OWNERS HOUSE HIS PARK HIS PARISH CHURCH HIS TOWN OR VILLAGE OF SOME PARTICULAR SPOT IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF HIS RESIDENCE OR OF SOME INCIDENT CONNECTED WITH HIS CAREER OR OCCUPATIONBE IT BUSINESS PROFESSION OR PLEASURE. FOR INSTANCE HORACE WALPOLE IN ONE OF HIS BOOKPLATES SHOWS US A VIEW OF HIS PALACE OF VARIETIES AT STRAWBERRY HILL SEE P. . AGAIN THOMAS GOSDEN THE ANGLER SPORTSMAN AND COLLECTOR OF ANGLING LITERATURE INTRODUCES INTO HIS BOOKPLATE ALL SORTS OF ANGLING AND SPORTING GEAR EVEN TO A CAPACIOUS WHISKY FLASK. THE HONBLE ROBERT HENRY SOUTHWELL LIEUT. ST REGIMENT OF HORSE  FLANKS HIS SHIELD WITH VARIOUS KINDS OF MILITARY WEAPONS AND TROPHIES WHILST CAPTAIN WILLIAM LOCKER ROYAL NAVY SHOWS US THE SWELLING BOSOM OF A MANOFWAR FORETOP GALLANT SAIL ON WHICH IS FIGURED HIS COAT OF ARMS.  WE WILL SPEAK FIRST OF THOSE BOOKPLATES ON WHICH THE LANDSCAPE IS REAL AND WE WILL CALL THEM VIEW PLATES. PROBABLY THE EARLIEST OF THESE IS THE VERY INTERESTING ONE SEE P.  WHICH WAS ENGRAVED BY MYNDE ABOUT  FOR THE LIBRARY OF THE PUBLIC RECORD OFFICE THEN IN THE TOWER OF LONDON HERE WE HAVE A REMARKABLY FAITHFUL REPRESENTATION OF THE HISTORIC BUILDING. THE DATE AT WHICH THE TOWER BOOKPLATE WAS PROBABLY ENGRAVED ADDS TO ITS INTEREST. PLATES IN THIS STYLE HARDLY APPEAR AT ALL BEFORE  OR  AND DO NOT BECOME COMMON TILL FIVE OR SIX YEARS LATER.  THE BOOKPLATE OF PETER MUILMAN OF KING ST. LONDON AND KIRBY HALL CASTLE HEDINGHAM ESSEX IS ONE WHICH I THINK MAY BE CLASSED AMONG VIEW PLATES SINCE THE RUINS DEPICTED ON IT HAVE CERTAINLY THE APPEARANCE OF HAVING BEEN SKETCHED FROM THE REMAINS OF SOME FEUDAL STRONGHOLD PERHAPS FROM CASTLE HEDINGHAM ITSELF. IN FRONT OF THE RUINS IS A WOODED LAWN ON WHICH TWO ROBUST CUPIDS ARE WRESTLING FOR THE MUILMAN ESCUTCHEON. KIRBY HALL IS NOT SHOWN NO DOUBT THIS WAS A COMFORTABLE GEORGIAN HOUSE ROUND THE CORNER WHERE PETER AND HIS FAMILY SPENT THEIR SUMMER HOLIDAYS AWAY FROM THE BUSTLE AND SMOKE OF KING STREET. PRESUMABLY THE RUINS OF THE CASTLE WERE LEFT STANDING IN THE PARK FOR ORNAMENTS SAKE TO GIVE A TONE OF FEUDALISM TO THE MUILMAN DOMAIN WHOSE OWNER SAVE BY HIS BOOKPLATE IS NOT KNOWN TO FAME. THE PLATE WAS ENGRAVED BY TERRY OF PATERNOSTER ROW PROBABLY ABOUT  SO THAT THIS AGAIN IS AN EARLY EXAMPLE OF ITS KIND.  ILLUSTRATION  AMONG OTHER NOTABLE SPECIMENS OF THESE VIEW BOOKPLATES MAY BE MENTIONED THAT WHICH PYE A BIRMINGHAM ENGRAVER EXECUTED FOR T. W. GREENE OF LICHFIELD. HERE WE HAVE AN OVALSHAPED SHIELD BEARING THE ARMS OF GREENE RESTING AGAINST A TREESTUMP. IN THE DISTANCE IS A RIVER AND LICHFIELD CATHEDRAL. LATER ON PYE ENGRAVED A VERY SIMILAR BOOKPLATE FOR ANOTHER LICHFIELD MANAN ATTORNEY NAMED NICHOLSON WHO WENT TO LIVE AT STOCKPORT. THIS SHOWS NICHOLSONS RESIDENCE ON THE MARGIN OF A SHEET OF WATER. THE ARMS REST AGAINST A SHATTERED OAKTREE. A LOCAL VIEWONE OF DARLINGTONALSO APPEARS ON THE BOOKPLATE OF GEORGE ALLEN WHO DESCRIBES HIMSELF AS OF THAT TOWN.  COLLECTORS ARE WONT TO RECKON AS THE MOST INTERESTING EXAMPLE OF A VIEW BOOKPLATE THE VIGNETTE OF HORACE WALPOLES HOUSE AT STRAWBERRY HILL WITH HIS ARMS HANGING ON A SHIELD FROM A WITHERED TREE. MR. WHEATLEY HOWEVER WHO IS INCLINED TO ATTRIBUTE THE DESIGN TO WALPOLES FRIEND BENTLEY HAS SUGGESTED BIBLIOGRAPHICA VOL. III. P.  THAT THE VIGNETTE WAS NEVER USED AS A BOOKPLATE BUT WAS EXCLUSIVELY RESERVED AS A KIND OF PRINTERS DEVICE FOR THE ADORNMENT OF THE BOOKS PRINTED AT THE STRAWBERRY HILL PRESS. SIR WOLLASTON FRANKS HAS FOUR VARIETIES OF THE VIGNETTE ONE ENGRAVED ON WOOD AND THREE ON COPPER AND I HAVE CERTAINLY SEEN AT LEAST ONE OF THEM DOING DUTY AS A BOOKPLATE BUT WHETHER RIGHTFULLY OR NOT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY.  MODERN EXAMPLES OF VIEW BOOKPLATES WERE TILL QUITE RECENTLY RARE. ONE OF THE QUAINTEST IS FURNISHED BY THAT USED BY THE LATE DR. KENDRICK OF WARRINGTON AND ENGRAVED FOR HIM IN  HERE WE HAVE A VIEW OF THE DOCTORS TOWN AS IT WAS IN  AND A PICTURE OF A LOYAL WARRINGTON VOLUNTEER OF . QUITE A USEFUL HISTORICAL PRINT  NOW LET ME SAY A WORD ABOUT THE PICTURE BOOKPLATES ON WHICH THE LANDSCAPE IS A FANCY ONE. PROMINENT AMONGST THESE IS THAT OF GILBERT WAKEFIELD WHICH SHOWS US A PRETTY SCENE A STAG STOOPS TO DRINK FROM A RIVULET THAT TRICKLES THROUGH A WOOD. VERY MUCH LATER IN DATE IS A CHARMING VIGNETTE REPRESENTING A ROCK OVER WHICH A STREAM OF WATER TRICKLES AND SPARKLES AS IT FALLS INTO A POOL BELOW. FERNS AND FLAGS GROW IN THE POOL. THE BOOKPLATE BELONGED TO JOSEPH PRIESTLEY AND ON THAT ACCOUNT WE MENTION IT AFTER WAKEFIELDS. PRIESTLEY WAS QUITE AS BITTER A DISSENTER AND AS ARDENT A CONTROVERSIALIST AS GILBERT WAKEFIELD THOUGH IT IS MORE AS A MAN OF SCIENCE THAT MOST PEOPLE REMEMBER HIM. HIS NAME IS SO INTIMATELY ASSOCIATED WITH BIRMINGHAM POLITICS AT THE TIME OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION THAT THE FACT OF HIS BOOKPLATE BEING ENGRAVED BY A BIRMINGHAM MANIT IS SIGNED ALLEN SCT. BIRMINGMBECOMES THE MORE INTERESTING AND ENABLES US TO ASSIGN THE ENGRAVING TO A MARKED PERIOD IN THE OWNERS LIFETHE TIME WHEN HIS FRIENDSHIP WITH LORD SHELBURNE BEGAN TO COOL AND WHEN SETTLING DOWN AT BIRMINGHAM HE BEGAN WORK ON HIS HISTORY OF THE CORRUPTIONS OF CHRISTIANITY. JAMES YATES WHO EDITED PRIESTLEYS COLLECTED WORKS USED THE SAME BOOKPLATE AFTER ALTERING THE NAME UPON IT.  ANOTHER DELIGHTFULLY RURAL SCENE IS DEPICTED ON THE BOOKPLATE OF JOHN HEWS BRANSBY. HIS MOTTO READS BREVE ET IRREPARABILE TEMPUS AND HE SHOWS A RUSTIC LANDSCAPE IN WHICH THE FIGURES REPRESENTED HAVE EVIDENTLY LEARNT THE TRUTH OF THE ASSERTION. THE SOWER SCATTERS SEED THE PLOUGHBOY IS ENGAGED WITH HIS TEAMALL ARE MAKING THE MOST OF THEIR TIME YET THERE IS NO SIGN OF HURRY OR BUSTLE. THE DAY IS FINE BUT CLOUDS HOVER IN THE SKY. ON THE LEFT A COTTAGE NESTLES IN THE TREES AND THE SMOKE FROM ITS CHIMNEY TELLS OF THE HOUSEWIFE WITHIN PREPARING A MEAL FOR THOSE WHO ARE EARNING IT BY THEIR LABOUR WITHOUT.  SO MUCH FOR LANDSCAPES HAVING DIRECT REFERENCE TO THE BOOKPLATES ON WHICH THEY APPEAR. OFTEN HOWEVER THE LANDSCAPE IS PURELY A FANCY ONE AS THAT ON THE BOOKPLATE OF GREGORY LOUIS WAY. A RIVER FLOWS THROUGH FIELDS AND BESIDE IT SITS AN ARMOURCOATED KNIGHT WHO IS EITHER WEARIED WITH THE FIGHT OR BOWED DOWN BY THE FICKLENESS OF HIS LADY. HIS SHIELD RESTS BESIDE HIM AND ON IT ARE DEPICTED THE ARMS OF WAY. THE MOON SHEDS UPON THE SCENE WHAT LIGHT SHE IS ABLE BUT THE SKY IS OVERCAST AND STORMY.  I MUST NOT CLOSE THIS CHAPTER WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE BOOKPLATES PRODUCED BY THOMAS BEWICK MANY OF WHICH ARE FAMILIAR ENOUGHAS EXAMPLES OF BEWICKS ARTTO THOSE WHO KNOW LITTLE ABOUT BOOKPLATES AND DO NOT COLLECT THEM. HIS ARE CERTAINLY FOR THE MOST PART LANDSCAPE PLATES BUT I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER TO CLASS THEM WITH THESE EXAMPLES OF VIEW BOOKPLATES OR WITH THOSE WHICH I HAVE CHRISTENED FANCY LANDSCAPES. THEY WERE CHIEFLY ENGRAVED FOR NORTHERN BOOKOWNERS BUT ONE CAN HARDLY SAY THAT THE PARTICULAR BIT OF SCENERY ON EACHTHOUGH DOUBTLESS IN MOST CASES DRAWN FROM NATUREHAS ANY SPECIAL APPLICABILITY TO THE OWNER. I WILL THEREFORE SPEAK HERE OF BEWICKS BOOKPLATES AS FORMING A CLASS BY THEMSELVES. HIS FIRST WAS PREPARED FOR THOMAS BELL AND IS DATED  SO THAT IT IS INACCURATE TO SPEAK OF BEWICK AS THE ORIGINATOR OF THE LANDSCAPE STYLE IN BOOKPLATES HE FOUND THE STYLE ALREADY FOLLOWED BY MANY ENGRAVERS AND HIS TASTE AND SKILL BROUGHT IT TO PERFECTION. THE BELL PLATE IS NOT UNCOMMON AS THE BOOKS FOR WHICH IT WAS ENGRAVED WERE SOLD IN . IT SHOWS IN THE FOREGROUND OF A LANDSCAPE AN OVAL SHIELD INSCRIBED T. BELL  AND RESTING AGAINST A DECAYED TREE. IN THE DISTANCE ARE TREES AND ABOVE THEM RISES THE TOWER OF ST. NICHOLASS CHURCH IN NEWCASTLEA FAVOURITE OBJECT WITH BEWICK. IT IS ALSO INTRODUCED BY RALPH BEILBY INTO THE BOOKPLATE OF BRAND THE ANTIQUARY.  OUT OF THE HUNDRED OR SO BOOKPLATES DESIGNED OR ENGRAVED BY BEWICK IT IS DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHICH TO SELECT FOR COMMENT BUT FROM THE INTEREST WHICH ATTACHES TO ITS OWNER THAT OF ROBERT SOUTHEY FIGURED ON P.  SUGGESTS ITSELF. HERE WE HAVE A ROCK THICKLY CROWNED WITH SHRUBBERY FROM WHICH A STREAM OF WATER FALLS INTO A BROOK BELOW. AGAINST THE FACE OF THE ROCK LEANS AN ARMORIAL SHIELD BEARING THE SOUTHEY ARMSA CHEVRON BETWEEN THREE CROSSES CROSSLET. ON THE GROUND TO THE RIGHT OF THE SHIELD AND IN CONTACT WITH IT IS THE HELMET SUPPORTING ON A WREATH THE CRESTAN ARM VESTED AND COUPED AT THE ELBOW HOLDING IN THE HAND A CROSSED CROSSLET. ACROSS THE SINISTER CHIEF CORNER OF THE SHIELD AND TRAILING THENCE TO THE GROUND IS THROWN THE RIBAND BEARING THE MOTTO IN LABORE QUIES. THE DATE OF THE BOOKPLATE IS PROBABLY ABOUT .  NOT ONLY NEWCASTLE ITSELF BUT THE WHOLE LINE OF COUNTRY ALONG THE RIVER THENCE TO TYNEMOUTH SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN BEWICKS SKETCHING GROUND AND MANY OF HIS SKETCHES HE USED FOR BOOKPLATES. JARROW AND TYNEMOUTH ITSELF WERE PARTICULARLY FAVOURITE SPOTS. OF THE LATTER PLACE HIS VIEWS WERE MOSTLY TAKEN FROM THE SEA AND AFFORD US DELIGHTFUL PICTURES OF WATER SHIPPING AND THE RUINS OF TYNEMOUTH PRIORY. THE BOOKPLATE OF CHARLES CHARLTON M.D. IS ONE OF THESE.  ILLUSTRATION SOUTHEYS BOOKPLATE BY BEWICK.  A GREAT MANY OF THE ORDINARY BITS OF LANDSCAPE WHICH BEWICK USED FOR BOOKPLATES HE AFTERWARDS UTILISED AS TAILPIECES FOR VARIOUS BOOKS ILLUSTRATED BY HIM. THE BOOKPLATE OF THE REV. H. COTES VICAR OF BEDLINGTON  WHICH SHOWS US THE REVEREND GENTLEMAN BUSILY ENGAGED IN FISHING DOUBTLESS A FAVOURITE SPORT WITH HIM IS AN INSTANCE OF THIS DIVERTED USE BUT IN THIS CASE WE KNOW THE HISTORY OF THE PLATE. MR. COTES HAD PRACTICALLY EDITED THE ARTISTS SECOND VOLUME OF BRITISH BIRDS AND AS A SLIGHT RETURN BEWICK PREPARED FOR HIM THE BOOKPLATE IN QUESTION BUT OWING TO A SUBSEQUENT QUARREL THE ARTIST NEVER GAVE THE PARSON THE BLOCK TURNING IT INSTEAD TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT.  THERE ARE A GREAT MANY MORE COPPERPLATE BOOKPLATES BY BEWICK THAN IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED. ONE OF THE MOST ELABORATE IS THAT OF BUDDLE ATKINSON WHICH REPRESENTS A BUBBLING TROUTSTREAM INTO WHICH AN ANGLER CASTS HIS LINE IN THE FOREGROUND IS A CREST ENCLOSED IN A SHIELD. OTHER COPPERPLATE WORK BY BEWICK IS FOUND IN THE BOOKPLATES OF EDWARD MOISES A.M.A SHIELD OF ARMS WITH BOOKS PENS ARTISTS TOOLS OF ALL KINDS AND MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS JAMES CHARLTON AND A. CLAPHAMTYNESIDE SCENES J. H. AFFLECK NEWCASTLEUPONTYNEA SHIELD OF ARMS IN THE MIDST OF FLOWERS AND FOLIAGE THOS CARR NEWCASTLEA SPRING OF WATER FLOWING FROM A ROCK AND SOME FEW OTHERS.  EXAMPLES OF THE MORE UNUSUAL DESIGNS IN BEWICKS BOOKPLATES I.E. THOSE IN WHICH SCENERY IS NOT DEPICTED ARE FOUND IN THE BOOKPLATES OF JOHN ANDERSON ST. PETERSBURGHA SPORTSMAN ON HORSEBACK WHICH WAS AFTERWARDS UTILISED AS A VIGNETTE IN BRITISH BIRDS MR. BIGGESA FIGURE OF LIBERTY ALEXR DOEG SHIPBUILDERA JUSTCOMPLETED SHIP STILL STANDING ON THE STOCKS AND SEVERAL OTHERS WHICH SIMPLY SHOW THE SHIELD OF ARMS AND OWNERS NAME.  ONE REASON WHY BEWICK WAS SO SUCCESSFUL AS AN ENGRAVER OF BOOKPLATES LAY IN THE FACT THAT HIS ABILITY WAS MOST CONSPICUOUS IN A SMALL DESIGN. THE WORK OF SUCH MEN AS HOGARTH OR BARTOLOZZI SEEMS CRAMPED WHEN IT APPEARS ON THE SMALL SCALE WHICH ALONE A BOOKPLATE CAN ADMIT BUT WITH BEWICK THE SMALLER THE SIZE OF THE SCENE HE DESIRED TO REPRESENT THE GREATER WAS HIS SKILL IN INTRODUCING INTO IT BOTH ORIGINALITY AND BEAUTY.     CHAPTER VI  GERMAN BOOKPLATES   I HAVE SAID THAT THE USE OF BOOKPLATES WHETHER AS COMMEMORATIVE OF GIFTS OR AS MARKS OF OWNERSHIP ORIGINATED IN GERMANY. HERE WELL BEFORE THE CLOSE OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY WE FIND AT LEAST THREE UNDOUBTED BOOKPLATES EXAMPLES OF WHICH HAVE SURVIVED UNTIL THE PRESENT DAY AND HAVE RECENTLY BEEN DISCOVERED FULFILLING THE FUNCTION FOR WHICH THEY WERE ORIGINALLY INTENDED.  FASTENED TO THE COVER OF AN OLD LATIN VOCABULARY WAS DISCOVERED THE MOST ANCIENT OF THESE BOOKPLATES. IT IS PRINTED FROM A WOODBLOCK AND IS ROUGH IN EXECUTION. IT SHOWS US A HEDGEHOG CARRYING A FLOWER IN ITS MOUTH TRAMPLING OVER FALLEN LEAVES ABOVE IS THE INSCRIPTION HANS IGLER DAS DICH EIN IGEL KUSS.  ILLUSTRATION BOOKPLATE OF HILDEBRANDE BRANDENBURG.  FOLLOWING IN POINT OF DATE CLOSELY AFTER THIS CURIOUS BOOKPLATE COMES A SMALL WOODCUT REPRESENTING AN ANGEL WHO HOLDS A SHIELD ON WHICH IS DISPLAYED A BLACK OX WITH A RING PASSED THROUGH ITS NOSETHE ARMS OF THE BRANDENBURG FAMILY. A WRITTEN INSCRIPTION BENEATH IT STATES THAT THE BOOK FOR WHICH IT WAS INTENDED AND IN WHICH IT WAS FOUND BELONGED TO HILDEBRANDE BRANDENBURG OF BIBERACH WHO PRESENTED IT TO THE CARTHUSIAN MONASTERY OF BUXHEIM OF WHICH HE WAS A MONK. THIS BOOKPLATE WHICH IS RUDELY COLOURED IS STRUCK OFF ON SCRAPS OF PAPER PRINTED ON ONE SIDE A CURIOUS ILLUSTRATION OF THE THEN SCARCITY OF THAT MATERIAL. ODDLY ENOUGH ANOTHER VERY EARLY BOOKPLATEPROBABLY OF ALMOST THE SAME DATE AS THE LASTWAS ALSO FOUND IN A BOOK WHICH BELONGED TO THE SAME MONASTERY AND WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN TO IT BY WILHELM VON ZELL. THIS BOOKPLATE ALSO IS ANONYMOUS BUT THE VOLUMES THAT CONTAINED IT AS IN THE LAST CASE BEAR A WRITTEN INSCRIPTION RECORDING THE FACT THAT THEY BELONGED TO THE MONASTERY IN QUESTION AND WERE THE GIFT OF THE PERSON WHOSE ARMS ARE FIGURED IN THE BOOKPLATE INSERTED.  FROM THE FACT THAT TWO OF THE THREE KNOWN FIFTEENTH CENTURY BOOKPLATES ARE CONNECTED WITH THE MONASTERY AT BUXHEIM IT WOULD SEEM AS IF THE USE OF A BOOKPLATE COMMENDED ITSELF TO THE LIBRARIAN OF THAT MONASTERY WHO COMMEMORATED THE GIFTS OF VOLUMES BY A BOOKPLATE BEARING THE DONORS ARMS.  IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY GERMAN BOOKPLATES BECAME NUMEROUS AND OF THEIR BEAUTY THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT. THERE IS A DIFFICULTY HOWEVER IN ACCEPTING MANY OF THE EARLY ARMORIAL WOODCUTS WHICH ONE FINDS AND IT IS THIS SUPPOSE THE EXAMPLE IS NO LONGER DOING DUTY IN A VOLUME AS A BOOKPLATE THERE IS REALLY NO MEANS OF BEING ASSURED THAT THE CUT OF ARMS IS A BOOKPLATE AT ALL FOR VERY MANY OF THESE PLATES ARE VOID OF ANY INSCRIPTION SAVE PERHAPS A TEXT OR MOTTO. SOME OF THESE BOOKPLATES ARE PROBABLY THE WORK OR FROM THE DESIGN OF ALBERT DRER. HE CERTAINLY PRODUCED SOME UNDOUBTED EXAMPLES THE EARLIEST ACTUALLY DATED IN . THIS IS THE EBNER BOOKPLATE SEE P. . THE INSCRIPTION ON THIS LEAVES US IN NO DOUBT AS TO ITS INTENDED USE LIBER HIERONIMI EBNER .  EIGHT YEARS AFTER COMPLETING THE EBNER PLATE DRER ENGRAVED ON COPPER A PORTRAIT PLATE OF BILIBALD PIRCKHEIMER A NUREMBERG JURIST OF SOME NOTE WHO BECAME COUNCILLOR TO MAXIMILIAN I. AND WAS THE OWNER OF A LIBRARY WHOSE SUBSEQUENT HISTORY HAS BEEN TOLD IN BOOKS ABOUT BOOKS BY MR. ELTON IN HIS GREAT BOOK COLLECTORS. NOW THIS PORTRAIT PLATE WHICH IS DATED  WAS UNDOUBTEDLY USED BY PIRCKHEIMER AS HIS BOOKPLATE. THERE ARE PLENTY OF KNOWN INSTANCES IN WHICH IT MAY BE STILL FOUND FASTENED IN AT THE END OF A VOLUME. WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS INTENDED FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE THAN THAT WHICH I HAVE HERE MENTIONED WE CANNOT SAY FOR IT BEARS NO INSCRIPTION EXPRESSING ITS USE. HOWEVERVERY POSSIBLY AT THE SAME DATEDRER DESIGNED FOR PIRCKHEIMER WHAT WAS WITHOUT DOUBT INTENDED FOR A BOOKPLATE SINCE IT BEARS THE INSCRIPTION LIBER BILIBALDI PIRCKHEIMER. THIS IS IN MANY INSTANCES FOUND ON THE FRONT COVER OF VOLUMES WHICH ALSO CONTAIN THE BOOKPLATE LAST DESCRIBED FASTENED ON THE BACK COVER.  IT IS A VERY STRIKING BOOKPLATE. A STRANGELY LARGE HELMET ON WHICH IS PLACED AN EQUALLY LARGE CREST SURMOUNTS A PAIR OF SHIELDS. THE DEXTER ONE BEARS THE ARMS OF PIRCKHEIMERA BIRKE OR BIRCHTREE WHILST THE SINISTER BEARS THOSE OF HIS WIFE MARGRETHA RIETERINA CROWNED MERMAID WITH TWO TAILS EACH OF WHICH SHE HOLDS IN HER HANDS. PIRCKHEIMERS ARMS SHOW THE CURIOUS PUNNING HERALDRY OF THE TIME THE BIRKE BEING NO DOUBT A PLAYFUL ALLUSION TO THE JURISTS NAME. CLASPING THE HELMET ARE TWO ANGELS. ON EITHER SIDE OF THE SHIELD IS A LARGE CORNUCOPIA APPARENTLY FILLED WITH GRAPES AND VINE LEAVES AND AMONGST THESE STANDS A SMALLER ANGEL HOLDING ONE END OF A HEAVY FESTOON THE OTHER END OF WHICH IS FASTENED TO A RAMS HEAD THE CENTRE OF THE DESIGN. ANGELS APPARENTLY AT PLAY ARE ALSO REPRESENTED BELOW THE SHIELD. EXAMPLES OF THIS PLATE ARE NOT UNCOMMON IN ENGLISH COLLECTIONS MANY OF PIRCKHEIMERS BOOKS HAVING PASSED INTO THE LIBRARY OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY AND SOME OF THESE HAVING BEEN SOLD AS DUPLICATES WHEN THEY WERE BOUGHT UP BY COLLECTORS FOR THE SAKE OF THE BOOKPLATE. SIR WOLLASTON FRANKS POINTS OUT TO ME THAT THERE IS YET A THIRD VARIETY OF PIRCKHEIMERS BOOKPLATE WHICH IS SIGNED J. B.  AND IS NOT THE WORK OF DRER.  ILLUSTRATION  THE BOOKPLATE OF HECTOR PMER PROVOST OF THE CHURCH OF ST. LAURENCE AT NUREMBERG DATED IN  IS ALSO ASCRIBED TO DRER THOUGH IT IS SIGNED WITH THE INITIALS R. A. THIS SIGNATURE IS PROBABLY THAT OF THE ARTIST WHO CUT THE DESIGN UPON WOOD FOR IT IS NOW MAINTAINED THAT DRER HIMSELF ONLY MADE THE DRAWINGS FOR THE WOODCUTS KNOWN AS HIS THE MECHANICAL OPERATION OF CUTTING BEING HANDED OVER TO ASSISTANTS. THE PMER PLATE IS THE EARLIEST DATED BOOKPLATE WHICH BEARS A SIGNATURE EITHER OF THE DESIGNER OR THE ENGRAVER.  THE SIZE OF THIS REALLY FINE EXAMPLE OF EARLY WOODENGRAVING IS  INCHES BY . ON THE PRINCIPAL SHIELD IN THE DESIGN WE HAVE WHAT ARE NO DOUBT THE ARMS OF THE MONASTERY THE GRIDIRON OF ST. LAURENCE QUARTERING THOSE OF PMER. THE GRIDIRON IS ON THE FIRST AND FOURTH QUARTERS WHILST THE SECOND AND THIRD CONTAIN WHAT IS HERALDICALLY DESCRIBED AS PER BEND SABLE  AND ARGENT THREE BENDLETS OF THE FIRST. WE SAY SABLE BECAUSE THE DARK MASS WHICH THE ARTIST HAS HERE SHOWN IS PROBABLY MEANT TO REPRESENT THIS BUT ANY DARK COLOUR MAY HAVE BEEN INTENDED AS I HAVE ALREADY ENDEAVOURED TO SHOW SEE P. . THESE LAST ARMS ARE VERY PROBABLY PMERS FOR IN ONE OF THE SMALL SHIELDS WHICH APPEAR IN EACH OF THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE DESIGN THEY OCCUR AGAINTHE OTHER THREE SHIELDS BEING MOST LIKELY FILLED WITH ARMS QUARTERED BY THE PMER FAMILY. THE HELMET SURMOUNTING THE PRINCIPAL SHIELD IS WITHOUT WREATH AND THE CREST IS A DEMINUN. THE MOTTO TO THE PURE ALL THINGS ARE PURE IS GIVEN AS IN OTHER OF DRERS BOOKPLATES IN HEBREW GREEK AND LATIN. IN CHARGE OF THE SHIELD STANDS ST. LAURENCE HIMSELF DRESSED IN A MONKS GARB AND HOLDING IN HIS RIGHT HAND THE INSTRUMENT OF HIS MARTYRDOM AND IN HIS LEFT THE PALM OF MARTYRDOM. THE NIMBUS APPEARS AROUND HIS HEAD. THE BEAUTY OF THE DESIGN IS APPARENT AT THE FIRST GLANCE AND IT BECOMES MORE APPARENT AS WE LOOK INTO IT.  DR. HECTOR PMER WAS THE LAST PRIOR OF THE ABBEY OF ST. LAURENCE IN NUREMBERG. TO HIM ERASMUS GAVE A COPY OF HIS EDITION OF THE WORKS OF ST. AMBROSE ISSUED FROM FROBENS PRESS. THAT VERY COPY IS IN THE POSSESSION OF THE REV. H. W. PEREIRA AND IN EACH OF THE TWO THICK VOLUMES IN WHICH THE WORK IS CONTAINED IS PMERS BOOKPLATE. ONE IS STRUCK WITH THE EXQUISITE DETAIL AND TREATMENT AS MR. PEREIRA SAYS IN DESCRIBING THE PLATE THE EXPRESSION AND FIGURE OF ST. LAURENCE IS FULL OF SWEETNESS AND TENDER PATHOS.  THE LIST OF ARMORIES BY DRER AS PRINTED BY BARTSCH IN VOL. VII. OF THE PEINTREGRAVEUR GIVES US SOME TWENTY EXAMPLES ANY OF WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN USED AS BOOKPLATES. SOME IDEA AS TO WHETHER OR NOT AN EARLY ARMORIAL PLATE IS REALLY A BOOKPLATE MAY HOWEVER BE GAINED BY TAKING ITS MEASUREMENT. A VERY LARGE ENGRAVING SHOULD BE REGARDED WITH SUSPICION THOUGH NOT NECESSARILY REJECTED AS A BOOKPLATE ON ACCOUNT OF ITS SIZE. SIR WOLLASTON FRANKS POSSESSES A MAGNIFICENT BOOKPLATE MEASURING NO LESS THAN    INCHES WHICH IS AT THIS MOMENT STILL FULFILLING ITS ORIGINAL FUNCTIONS. THIS IS CERTAINLY THE LARGEST EXAMPLE YET DISCOVERED. IT HAS BEEN KNOWN TO COLLECTORS FOR SOME TIME IN WHAT WAS BELIEVED TO BE A PERFECT STATE BUT THE COPY JUST MENTIONED SHOWS THAT WHAT WAS THOUGHT TO BE THE WHOLE WAS IN REALITY ONLY A PORTION OF THE DESIGN SINCE IT LACKED THE ELABORATE FRAMEWORK WHICH IS RICHLY EMBELLISHED WITH WEAPONS AND ENSIGNS AS WELL AS WITH MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION. THIS BOOKPLATE BELONGED TO COUNT MAXIMILIAN LOUIS BREINER A DISTINGUISHED OFFICIAL OF THE EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA IN LOMBARDY. A STRIKING FEATURE IN IT IS THE INTRODUCTION ABOVE THE ARMS OF THE OWNER OF THE PLATE OF THOSE OF AUSTRIA SURMOUNTED BY THE IMPERIAL CROWN SUPPORTED BY A COUPLE OF CHERUBS. BOTH THE DESIGN AND ENGRAVING ARE THE WORK OF GIUSEPPE PETRARCA WHO PROBABLY PRODUCED THEM DURING THE CLOSING YEARS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.  ILLUSTRATION  QUITE IN A DISTINCT STYLE FROM THE OTHER GERMAN BOOKPLATES MENTIONED IS THAT FIGURED OPPOSITE WHICH MAY BE DATED ABOUT THE YEAR . IT IS INTERESTING FROM ITS OWNER ONE PAULUS SPERATUS AN ARDENT PREACHER OF THE LUTHERAN DOCTRINE AT AUGSBURG WRTTEMBERG SALZBURG AND VIENNA AND AFTERWARDS BISHOP OF POMERANIA WHO PROVED HIMSELF READY TO UNDERGO SUFFERING IN THE CAUSE HE IMAGINED TO BE RIGHT. HE WAS BORN IN  AND DIED IN . THE SHADING IN THE ARMS IS VERY PECULIAR EXPRESSING AS IT DOES ON THE FIRST AND FOURTH DIVISIONS OF THE SHIELD ARGENT AND VERT AT A PERIOD AS WE HAVE SEEN LONG ANTERIOR TO THE USE OF LINES OR DOTS TO EXPRESS THE METALS OR TINCTURES IN HERALDRY. AN EXPLANATION IS NO DOUBT TO BE FOUND IN THE FACT THAT THE ARTIST ONLY INTENDED TO REPRESENT SOME LIGHT COLOUR IN THE SHADED PARTS IN THE SAME WAY AS IN THE SECOND AND THIRD DIVISIONS OF THE SHIELD HE DESIRED IN THE THICKLY INKED PARTS TO REPRESENT SABLE. THE BOOKPLATE IS NOW PRESERVED IN A COPY OF THE PSALMS TRANSLATED INTO RUSSIAN BY FRANCIS SKORINA AND PRINTED AT WILNA ABOUT THE YEAR . THE PECULIAR INSCRIPTION ON THIS BOOKPLATE IS REFERRED TO ON P. .  WE HAVE SPOKEN SOMEWHAT FULLY ABOUT THESE EARLY EXAMPLES OF GERMAN BOOKPLATES BECAUSE BOTH FROM THE FACT THAT THEY ARE THE EARLIEST KNOWN TO US AND THAT SEVERAL OF THEM ARE THE DESIGNS OF ALBERT DRER THEY HAVE A VERY SPECIAL INTEREST. SPACE PRECLUDES THE POSSIBILITY OF ALLUDING IN DETAIL TO LATER GERMAN EXAMPLES THOUGH THEY ARE MANY OF THEM EXCEEDINGLY BEAUTIFUL SPECIMENS OF THE ENGRAVERS ART AS INDEED THEY MAY WELL BE CONSIDERING THE MEN WHO ENGRAVED THEMLUCAS CRANACH JOST AMMAN HANS TROSCHEL WOLFFGANG KILIAN OF AUGSBURG AND THE UNCLE AND NEPHEW GILES AND JOSEPH SADELER.  LET ME HOWEVER SPEAK VERY TERSELY OF A FEW EXAMPLES OF THE PRODUCTIONS OF THESE ARTISTS IN ORDER THAT THE READERS ATTENTION MAY BE ATTRACTED SHOULD HE COME ACROSS A SPECIMEN OF THEIR WORK.  TWO WOODCUTS BY LUCAS CRANACH HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN USED AS BOOKPLATES THOUGH NOT DESIGNED BY THE ARTIST AS SUCH FOR THEY BOTH APPEAR AMONG OTHER CUTS IN A WORK ILLUSTRATED BY HIM. SIR WOLLASTON FRANKS POSSESSES BOTH VARIETIES. IN ONE WE HAVE A HALFLENGTH FIGURE OF ST. PAUL. HE IS SEATED AND READING A BOOK THE LINES OF WHICH HE FOLLOWS WITH HIS FINGER. HIS HEAD IS SURROUNDED WITH THE NIMBUS WHILST A SHAGGY BEARD NEARLY COVERS THE FACE. THE RIGHT HAND HOLDS A DOUBLE SWORD WITH THE POINTS UPWARDS BENEATH THIS IS THE SHIELD OF THE ELECTOR OF SAXONY. ABOVE THE UPPER LINE OF THE PLATE IS AN INSCRIPTION SHOWING THAT IT WAS INTENDED TO MARK THE VOLUMES BELONGING TO THE PREACHERSHIP PREDICATUR AT ORINGEN. THE OTHER WOODCUT BY CRANACH IS VERY SIMILAR IN DESIGN BUT THE FIGURE REPRESENTED IS THAT OF ST. PETER AND IT BEARS THE INSCRIPTION STADT ORNGAU.  IT IS WORTH REMARKING THAT IN ONE INSTANCE AT LEAST ON REMOVING THE BOOKPLATE PORTRAYING ST. PAUL A SMALLER HANDDRAWN BOOKPLATE WAS FOUND WHICH CONSISTED OF A SHIELD HALF RED AND HALF WHITE AND UPON IT A KEY PLACED IN PALE COUNTERCHARGED. THERE IS NO INSCRIPTION ON THIS BOOKPLATE NOR IS THERE ANY MARGIN SHOWNTHE PAPER BEING CUT CLOSE TO THE DESIGN.  JOST AMMAN IS ANOTHER GERMAN ARTIST WHO LEAVES US IN A DIFFICULTY AS TO DECIDING AS TO WHICH OF HIS MANY ARMORIAL ENGRAVINGS WERE REALLY INTENDED FOR BOOKPLATES. ONE UNDOUBTED BOOKPLATE BY HIM HOWEVER EXISTS AND THIS WAS DESIGNED FOR A MEMBER OF THE NUREMBERG FAMILY OF HOLZSCHUHERWOODEN SHOES. WOODEN SHOES OR SABOTS APPEAR AS CHARGES ON THE SHIELD AND AFFORD ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE PUNNING HERALDRY WHICH WAS THEN FASHIONABLE IN GERMANY. THIS IS A FINE BOOKPLATE ENGRAVED ON COPPER AND SIGNED J. A. ITS SIZE    INCHES. THE SHIELD IS SUPPORTED BY TWO ANGELS AND A LION.  HANS SIBMACHER OR SIEBMACHER WAS ANOTHER NUREMBERG ENGRAVER HE WORKED THERE QUITE AT THE CLOSE OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY AND IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THE SEVENTEENTH. HE ALSO EXECUTED A BOOKPLATE FOR A MEMBER OF THE HOLZSCHUHER FAMILY. THIS IS A MORE ELABORATE PIECE OF WORK THAN AMMANS THOUGH SMALLER    INCHES. ITS CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE IS A CLOSELYWOVEN WREATH OF LEAVES WITH CLUSTERS OF FRUIT AND ORNAMENTS INTRODUCED AT INTERVALS. SEATED ON THIS WREATH AT THE TOP OF THE DESIGN ARE TWO READING CHERUBS CLOTHED IN NATURE UNADORNED. BELOW THE DESIGN IS AN OBLONG AND INDENTED BRACKET.  HANS TROSCHELS WORK AS A BOOKPLATE ENGRAVER IS ILLUSTRATED BY THE BOOKPLATE OF YET ANOTHER NUREMBERG MANJOHN WILLIAM KRESS OF KRESSENSTAIN DATED IN . IN THIS WE ARE SHOWN A SHIELD SET IN AN OVAL WREATH OF LEAFWORK. THE HELMET WHICH SURMOUNTS IT DISPLAYS SOME ELABORATE WORK FINELYCUT MANTLING EXTENDS ITSELF FROM THIS ON THE RIGHT SIDE AND ON THE LEFT AND ABOVE IS A CORNET WHICH ENCIRCLES THE CREST. THE WHOLE IS ENCLOSED IN A CIRCLE OF LEAVES AND BERRIES SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THAT JUST DESCRIBED IN SPEAKING OF SIBMACHERS WORK BUT OUTSIDE THIS AT EACH OF THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE PLATE ARE SMALL SHIELDS SURMOUNTED BY HELMETS AND CRESTS AND CONTAINING THE ARMS OF THE FOUR FAMILIES FROM WHICH HE IMMEDIATELY DESCENDED THEIR NAMES BEING GIVEN. NESTLING AMONGST THE MANTLING ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE DESIGN IS A DISTINCT SHIELD ON WHICH ARE DEPICTED THE ARMS OF SUSANNA KOLER WIFE OF THE OWNER OF THE BOOKPLATE.  WOLFFGANG KILIAN BORN  DIED  WAS AN AUGSBURG MAN AND THE BOOKPLATE WHICH BEARS HIS SIGNATURE AND THE DATE  IS THAT OF AN AUGSBURG CHURCH DIGNITARYSEBASTIAN MYLLER SUFFRAGANBISHOP OF ADRAMYTTEUM AND CANON OF AUGSBURG. IN ITS ORNAMENTATION IT BEARS SOME RESEMBLANCE TO AN ENGLISH JACOBEAN BOOKPLATE. ABOVE THE SHIELD IS THE HEAD OF A CHERUB ON WHICH THE EPISCOPAL MITRE IS MADE TO REST IN A SOMEWHAT COMICAL MANNER THE CHERUBS WINGS PROTRUDE OVER THE TOP OF AND INTO THE SHIELD. THE INSCRIPTION IS CONTAINED IN AN OVAL BAND OUTSIDE THIS IS AN OVAL LEAFWREATH AND OUTSIDE THIS AGAIN AN INDENTED FRAME. WOLFFGANG WAS A YOUNGER BROTHER OF THE MORE NOTED LUCAS KILIAN. BOTH BROTHERS STUDIED AT VENICE AND WERE PUPILS OF THEIR STEPFATHER DOMINICK CUSTOS WHO WAS HIMSELF A DESIGNER OF BOOKPLATES.  OF GILES SADELERS WORKTHE COUNT OF ROSENBERGS BOOKPLATEI SHALL SPEAK DIRECTLY PP.  . AN EXAMPLE OF HIS NEPHEWS ENGRAVING IS AFFORDED BY THE BOOKPLATE OF FERDINAND VON HAGENAU DATED IN .  IN LATER TIMESTHE EIGHTEENTH CENTURYOTHER DISTINGUISHED GERMAN ARTISTS STOOPED TO BOOKPLATE ENGRAVING. AMONGST THEM WAS DANIEL NICHOLAS CHODOWIECKI THE SON OF A DANTZIG DRUG MERCHANT BORN IN . CHODOWIECKI IS BEST KNOWN AS A BOOKILLUSTRATOR IN WHICH HIS GREAT KNOWLEDGE OF COSTUMEAT A PERIOD WHEN THE POINT WAS LITTLE STUDIEDSTOOD HIM IN GOOD STEAD. HIS BOOKPLATES ARE PROBABLY FEW ONLY FOUR OR FIVE ARE KNOWN. ONE OF THE MOST ELABORATE IN DESIGN IS THAT OF A GERMAN DOCTOR OF MEDICINE DATED IN  NINE YEARS BEFORE THE ARTISTS DEATH.  IN THIS EXAMPLE MUCH OF THE SENSATIONAL STYLE OF THE GENERALITY OF HIS WORK MANIFESTS ITSELF. THE BOOKPLATE SAYS LORD DE TABLEY IN ITS MOTIVE REMINDS US MUCH OF THOSE ALLEGORIC FRAMED CERTIFICATES OF MEMBERSHIP WHICH VARIOUS SICK CLUBS AND BENEFIT SOCIETIES ACCORD TO THEIR MEMBERS AT THE PRESENT DAY. IN THE FOREGROUND SCULAPIUS IS PUSHING OUT A SKELETON DRAPED IN A LONG WHITE SHEET WITH A SCYTHE ACROSS ITS SHOULDER. THE GOD IS STURDILY APPLYING HIS SERPENTTWINED STAFF TO THE SOMEWHAT TOO SOLID BACK OF THE TERRIBLE PHANTOM. BEHIND BENEATH A KIND OF PAVILION LIES A SICK PERSON IN BED HIS HANDS ARE UPRAISED IN SILENT THANKFULNESS AS HE WATCHES THE PROWESS OF THE HEALING DEITY. THE BOOKPLATE WAS ENGRAVED FOR DR. C. S. SCHINTZ. BESIDES THIS CHODOWIECKI ENGRAVED ABOUT  A BOOKPLATE FOR HIMSELF AND ABOUT TEN YEARS LATER ONE FOR THE FRENCH SEMINARY AT BERLIN.  ILLUSTRATION  THE BOOKPLATE OF DR. SCHINTZ CALLS TO MIND A SOMEWHAT EARLIER GERMAN EXAMPLE ENGRAVED BY BOETIUS FROM A DESIGN BY WERNERIN WHOSE SIGNATURE APPEARS ON SOME VARIETIES OF THE PLATE ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY. IT IS FIGURED OPPOSITE AND IS PERHAPS THE MOST GLOOMY BOOKPLATE THAT IT EVER ENTERED INTO THE MIND OF MAN TO CONCEIVE. A SKELETON SITS UPON A COFFIN OR A COFFINSHAPED TOMB HOLDING IN HIS RIGHT HAND A PAIR OF SCALES AND IN HIS LEFT A SCYTHE IN THE LIGHTER BALANCE OF THE SCALES IS A SCROLL BEARING THE INSCRIPTION DAN. V.  MENE TEKEL IN THE BACKGROUND WE SEE MONUMENTS LOMBARDY POPLARS OR CYPRESSTREES AND A DISTANT LANDSCAPE. THIS UNINVITING PICTURE IS CONTAINED IN A FRAME INSCRIBED IN A MEDALLION ABOVE E BIBLIOTHECA WOOGIANA AND BELOW NOMINOR  LIBRA LIBRATUS NE LEVIS UNQUAM INVENIAR PRSTA PONDERE CHRISTE TUOA MOTTO IN WHICH THE OWNER MAKES A PLAY UPON THE DERIVATION OF HIS NAME FROM WAGE THE GERMAN FOR A WEIGHT OR BALANCE AND ASKS THE BESTOWAL OF DIVINE WEIGHT ON THE DAY OF SOULWEIGHING.  AS COMPARED WITH GERMAN BOOKPLATES THOSE OF OTHER COUNTRIES ARE SADLY DEFICIENT IN ARTISTIC COMPOSITION. THE FORMER PARTICULARLY EXAMPLES OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY ARE ORNATE AND WELL DESIGNED.  TAKE FOR INSTANCE THE REALLY MAGNIFICENT BOOKPLATE OF PETER VOK URSINUS COUNT OF ROSENBERG DATED . IT IS ENGRAVED ON COPPER AND MEASURES  INCHES BY . IN A CENTRAL CIRCULAR MEDALLION  INCHES IN DIAMETER IS DEPICTED THE OWNER ARRAYED IN ARMOUR AND SEATED ON A RICHLY CAPARISONED WARHORSE PLUMED AND GOING AT FULL SPEED ACROSS A LANDSCAPE OF HILLOCKS. ON HIS BREASTPLATE IS AN ESCUTCHEON BEARING HIS ARMS A KNIGHTS SWORD IS IN HIS HAND. ROUND THE MARGIN OF THE MEDALLION RUNS A WREATH OF ROSES. PLATFORMS COME OUT ON EITHER SIDE OF THE MEDALLION AND ON EACH OF THESE THERE STANDS A FIGURE ABOUT  INCHES IN HEIGHT THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS A FEMALE SYMBOLICAL FORM CLAD IN FLOWING DRAPERY AND HOLDING IN ONE HAND THE CUP OF THE EUCHARIST AND IN THE OTHER A CROSS. A SOMEWHAT SIMILAR FIGURE STANDS ON THE RIGHT HOLDING IN HER HAND A TABLET INSCRIBED VERBUM DOMINI MANET IN ETERNUM.  THE MEDALLION RESTS UPON TWO BEARSAN ALLUSION OF COURSE TO THE FAMILY NAME OF THE OWNER URSINUSCROUCHING BETWEEN THE TWO FEMALE FIGURES DESCRIBED. THE FACE OF THE ALTARLIKE PLATFORM BELOW IS DIVIDED INTO ONE CENTRAL AND TWO LATERAL COMPARTMENTS OF WHICH THE SIDE ONES PROJECT FORWARD. ON THE RIGHT LATERAL SLAB IS AN ESCUTCHEON CHARGED SIMPLY WITH THE ROSENBERG ROSE WHILST ON THE LEFT WE SEE THE FAMILY ARMS AS ON THE BREASTPLATE BUT SURMOUNTED WITH AN ERMINEFACED CROWN. ON THE CENTRAL SLAB IS A SKULL RESTING ON TWO SHINBONES.  REACHING ACROSS THE UPPER PORTION OF THE DESIGN IS AN OBLONG TABLET WITH INDENTED SHELLY SCROLLWORK EDGES AND A BACKGROUND BORDER OF LARGE FULLBLOWN ROSES WITH THORNY STEMS. WITH THE INSCRIPTION WHICH IS APPROPRIATELY POMPOUS I NEED NOT TROUBLE THE READER BUT I HAVE THOUGHT IT WORTH WHILE TO GIVE HERE FOLLOWING LORD DE TABLEYS EXAMPLE AND USING SOMETIMES HIS WORDS A VERY FULL VERBAL PICTURE OF THIS TRULY MAGNIFICENT BOOKPLATE IN ORDER THAT THE PITCH OF ELABORATION TO WHICH A GERMAN BOOKPLATE CAN BE CARRIED MAY BE UNDERSTOOD. SUFFICE IT TO ADD THAT THIS WORK OF ART WAS ENGRAVED BY GILES SADELER THE ANTWERPBORN ENGRAVER WHO AFTER STUDYING IN ITALY WAS INVITED BY THE EMPEROR RUDOLPH II. TO ENTER HIS SERVICE AT PRAGUE IN SHORT TO BECOME WHAT HE STYLES HIMSELF IN HIS SIGNATURE TO THIS BOOKPLATEENGRAVER TO HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY.  LESS ELABORATE YET VERY BEAUTIFULLY ENGRAVED ARE THE BOOKPLATES USED IN THE ELECTORAL LIBRARY OF THE DUKES OF BAVARIA AT MUNICH. ON ONE DATED IN  THE LARGEST VARIETY OF WHICH IS  INCHES HIGH AND  BROAD WE HAVE THE ARMS OF THE DUCHY ENCLOSED BY THE COLLAR OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE. WINGED CARYATIDES SUPPORT THE ELECTORAL CROWN WHILST BELOW IS AN ARABESQUED PLATFORM ON WHICH IS THE INSCRIPTION EX BIBLIOTHECA SERENISSIMORUM UTRIUSQUE BAVARI DUCUM . A SMALLER VARIETY OF THIS PLATE IS FIGURED OPPOSITE. SOME TWENTY YEARS LATER A STILL LARGER AND MORE ORNATE BOOKPLATE    INCHES WAS DESIGNED FOR USE IN THE SAME LIBRARY. HERE THE ARMS ARE IN AN OVAL FRAME SURROUNDED BY THE GOLDEN FLEECE ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT ARE INVERTED CORNUCOPI AND THE CROWN IS HELD ALOFT BY FOUR CHERUBS. ALL THE BOOKPLATES OF THIS LIBRARY EXIST IN A GREAT VARIETY OF DESIGN AND NEARLY ALL THE VARIETIES ARE FOUND IN DIFFERENT SIZES.  ILLUSTRATION  THESE EXAMPLES ARE TYPICAL OF MANY OTHER GERMAN BOOKPLATES THE CONCEPTION OF THE DESIGN IS EXCELLENT AND ITS WORKING OUT IS EQUALLY GOOD. IN LATER TIMES THE WORK ON BOOKPLATES PERHAPS DETERIORATED BECAUSE IT FELL TO A LARGE EXTENT INTO INFERIOR HANDS. YET GERMANY CAN SHOW SEVERAL VERY CREDITABLE EXAMPLES IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. SOME OF THOSE WHICH GIVE THE VIEW OF A LIBRARY INTERIOR ARE DECIDEDLY PLEASING THEY APPEAR SOON AFTER THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE CENTURY. THE LIBRARIES REPRESENTED HAVE USUALLY ONE OR MORE MYTHOLOGICAL INMATES BUT IN ONE INSTANCE THE OWNER IS IN POSSESSION AND IS SEEN HARD AT WORK AMONGST HIS VOLUMES.  IN CONCLUDING THIS CHAPTER IT MAY BE NOTED THAT EXAMPLES OF NAMETICKETS ARE FOUND IN GERMANY AS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. PERHAPS THE EARLIEST IS ONE FIRST NOTICED I BELIEVE BY MR. WEALE IN A COPY AT THE BODLEIAN LIBRARY OF A GERMAN PSALTER PRINTED AT AUGSBURG IN . THIS READS SUM MAGISTRI GEORGII MAYRII MONACENCIS I.E. OF MUNICH WITH THE MOTTO MELIUS EST PRO VERITATE PATI SUPPLICIUM QUAM PRO ADULATIONE CONSEQUI BENEFICIUM. THE SAME INSCRIPTION HAS BEEN WRITTEN IN INK ON THE TITLEPAGE WITH THE ADDED DATE  AND AFTERWARDSNO DOUBT A FEW YEARS LATER WHEN THE LABEL WAS PRINTED AND PLACED IN THE BOOKCROSSED THROUGH.  THE MOST COMPLETE WORK ON GERMAN BOOKPLATES THAT HAS YET MADE ITS APPEARANCE IS HERR WARNECKES DIE DEUTSCHEN BCHERZEICHEN BERLIN  BUT A WORK PROPERLY CLASSIFYING THE DIFFERENT STYLES OF GERMAN BOOKPLATES AND AFFIXING TO THESE STYLES COVERING DATES HAS YET TO BE WRITTEN.     CHAPTER VII  THE BOOKPLATES OF FRANCE AND OTHER COUNTRIES   FRANCE SO FAR AS A GENERALLY DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT OF HER BOOKPLATES IS CONCERNED IS CERTAINLY MORE FORTUNATE THAN HER NEIGHBOUR GERMANY. FRENCH BOOKPLATES RECEIVED ATTENTION IN THE SHAPE OF A CAPITAL WORK UPON THEM BEFORE THOSE OF ANY OTHER COUNTRY WERE SIMILARLY HONOURED. M. POULET MALASSISS LES EX LIBRIS FRANAIS MADE ITS FIRST APPEARANCE IN  AND BEARS EVIDENT TESTIMONY TO THE FACT THAT THE AUTHOR HAD FOR MANY YEARS PREVIOUSLY MADE AN ATTENTIVE STUDY OF HIS NATIVE BOOKPLATES.  SINCE THE APPEARANCE OF M. POULET MALASSISS WORK BOOKPLATE COLLECTING IN FRANCE AS WELL AS IN OTHER COUNTRIES HAS BEEN VIGOROUSLY CARRIED ON AND EARLIER EXAMPLES OF DATED FRENCH BOOKPLATES THAN THOSE THEN KNOWN HAVE COME TO LIGHT. THE MOST ANCIENT OF THESE IS ONE DATED  THE SAME YEAR IT WILL BE NOTED AS THAT OF THE PLATE OF SIR NICHOLAS BACON BUT IT IS SIMPLY TYPOGRAPHICAL HAVING NO KIND OF DESIGN WHATEVER. IT READS EX BIBLIOTHECA CAROLI ALBOSII E. EDUENSIS. EX LABORE QUIES. NO ARMORIAL BOOKPLATE BEARING AN ENGRAVED DATE APPEARS IN FRANCE UNTIL THIRTYSEVEN YEARS LATER WHEN WE AT LAST MEET WITH THAT OF ALEXANDRE BOUCHART VICOMTE DE BLOSSVILLE ENGRAVED BY LONARD GAULTIER AND IN THE COPY IN THE BIBLIOTHQUE NATIONALE DATED . A VARIETY OF THIS BOOKPLATE UNDATED UNSIGNED AND PROBABLY NOT BY THE SAME HAND EXISTS IN THE COLLECTION OF SIR WOLLASTON FRANKS. THE FIELD IN THE BOUCHART ARMS IS GULES THOUGH THE LINES SHOWN IN THE ENGRAVING OF THE UNDATED PLATE WOULD ACCORDING TO THE PRESENT SYSTEM REPRESENT IT AS AZURE SEE REMARKS ON THIS POINT AT P. . AFTER THE BOUCHART BOOKPLATE WE HAVE IN  THAT OF MELCHIOR DE LA VALLE CANON OF NANCY GIVEN BY M. POULET MALASSIS AS DATED IN  AND THEN IN  A ROUGHLYEXECUTED ANONYMOUS BOOKPLATE SIGNED RAIGNIAULD RIOMI . THE ARMS ARE UNTINCTURED AND LEAFLIKE MANTLING FALLING FROM THE HELMET SURROUNDS THE SHIELD THERE IS NO CREST. RAIGNIAULDOR AS THE MODERN SPELLING OF THE NAME IS REGNAULTIS NOT A KNOWN ENGRAVER. RIOMI IS AN OLDFASHIONED TOWN OF AUVERGNE.  OTHER FRENCH BOOKPLATES OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY BOTH DATED AND UNDATED EXIST BUT FRANCE IS UNDENIABLY BEHIND GERMANY BOTH IN THE NUMBER OF HER EARLY BOOKPLATES AND IN THEIR BEAUTY FOR INSTANCE WE DO NOT IN FRANCE FIND THOSE NUMEROUS BOOKPLATES OF ECCLESIASTICAL CORPORATIONS WHICH SO MUCH SWELL THE LIST OF EARLY GERMAN EXAMPLES. THE SUBJECT OF FRENCH ECCLESIASTICAL BOOKPLATES HAS INDEED RECEIVED SPECIAL TREATMENT FROM FATHER INGOLD HIMSELF A FRENCH ECCLESIASTIC AND HE IS COMPELLED TO ADMIT THAT SUCH BOOKPLATES ARE NOT NUMEROUS AND NOT ANCIENT. THE OLD WAY SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN FOR THE MONASTIC OFFICIAL IN CHARGE OF THE CONVENT LIBRARY TO INSCRIBE EACH VOLUME WITH SOME APPROPRIATE INSCRIPTION. THESE ARE IN THEMSELVES INTERESTING BUT BOOKPLATE LOVERS MUST REGRET THE EXISTENCE OF THE FASHION. THE EARLIEST FRENCH ECCLESIASTICAL BOOKPLATES BELONG TO THE MIDDLE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY AND LIKE THE  EXAMPLE ALREADY NOTICED THEY ARE MERE TYPOGRAPHICAL LABELS POSSESSING LITTLE MORE ARTISTIC MERIT THAN IS USUALLY DISPLAYED IN A POSTMARK.  WITH REGARD HOWEVER TO THE BOOKPLATES OF ECCLESIASTICAL INDIVIDUALS THE CASE IS DIFFERENT SOME OF THEM ENGRAVED DURING THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY ARE AMBITIOUS AND INTERESTING. A PARTICULARLY QUAINT EXAMPLE IS FOUND IN THE BOOKPLATE WHICH AN ANNECY ENGRAVER NAMED SINTON EXECUTED FOR CHARLES DE SALES THE ENERGETIC LABOURER IN THE CAUSE OF RELIGION BROTHER OF ST. FRANCIS DE SALES AND HIS SUCCESSOR IN THE BISHOPRIC OF ANNECY. LORD DE TABLEY THUS DESCRIBES THE BOOKPLATETHE FAMILY ARMS ARE SHOWN IN A SHIELD WHICH APPEARS VERY GIGANTIC IN A FRAME OF HEAVY CURVES WHICH IS SET IN THE CENTRE OF A HUGE SIDEBOARDLIKE MONUMENTAL STRUCTURE. ON THE TOP LEDGES OF THIS TWO FULLGROWN LONGSKIRTED ANGELS SEATED RIGHT AND LEFT UPHOLD THE EPISCOPAL HAT WITH ITS USUAL KNOTTED ROPES AND TASSELS IN AIR ABOVE THE ESCUTCHEON.  AT THE BASE OF THE STRUCTURE TO THE RIGHT APPEARS A FIGURE OF ST. FRANCIS DE SALES SEATED HOLDING AN OLIVE BRANCH IN ONE HAND WHILE BENEATH HIS OTHER ARM IS A PROFUSE CLUSTER OF FRUIT. TO THE LEFT ALSO SEATED IS A PORTRAIT OF ST. JANE FRANCES DE CHANTAL HOLDING A PALMBRANCH ALSO WITH FRUIT BENEATH HER OTHER ARM. EACH PORTRAIT IS REALISTIC AND NOT IN THE LEAST FLATTERED. BETWEEN THEM IS A MEDALLION BEARING THE CROSSED PAPAL KEYS.  THE PROBABLE DATE OF THIS VERY CURIOUS BOOKPLATE IS . IT APPEARS EARLIER BUT THIS MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE FACT THAT THE WORK IS PROVINCIAL. STUDENTS WILL DO WELL TO REMEMBER THAT PROVINCIALLY EXECUTED BOOKPLATES ENGLISH OR FOREIGN ARE OFTEN MISLEADING IN THIS RESPECT.  THERE IS A SOMEWHAT ELABORATE BOOKPLATE ENGRAVED IN SEVERAL SIZES AND DATED IN  WHICH INTRODUCES THE CARDINALS HAT MITRE AND CROZIER AND WHICH WAS PREPARED TO PLACE IN THE BOOKS GIVEN BY DR. PETER DANIEL HUET TO THE PARIS JESUITS. HUET IS HIMSELF AN INTERESTING FIGURE IN FRENCH LITERATURE. IN  HE WAS MADE TUTOR TO THE DAUPHIN AND WHILST SO EMPLOYED HE ASSISTED IN BRINGING OUT THE SIXTYTWO VOLUMES OF CLASSICS SPECIALLY PREPARED FOR HIS PUPIL KNOWN AS THE DELPHIN EDITION. HE BECAME BISHOP OF AVRANCHES IN  BUT TEN YEARS AFTER RESIGNED HIS SEE IN ORDER TO DEVOTE THE REMAINDER OF HIS LIFE TO LITERATURE WHICH HE DID COMPLETING AMONGST OTHER VOLUMINOUS WORKS A DEFENCE OF THE DOCTRINE OF CHRISTIANITY.  ILLUSTRATION BOOKPLATE OF CHARLES DE SALES.  IT IS FROM THEIR POSSESSORS THAT FRENCH BOOKPLATES DERIVE THEIR CHIEF INTEREST AND THESE POSSESSORS ARE FOR THE MOST PART PERSONS WHO LIVED AT A LATE DATE. AMONGST THE FEW EARLY CELEBRITIES IS THE SOLDIERPOET OF FRANCE FRANCIS DE MALHERBE OF WHOM IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT HE WAS AS LAX IN MORALS AS HE WAS RIGID IN HIS ZEAL FOR THE PURITY OF HIS NATIVE LANGUAGE. HIS BOOKPLATE IS FIGURED AT P.  AND IS INTERESTING AS SHOWING THAT NO RELIANCE CAN BE PLACED ON LINES APPARENTLY EXPRESSING THE COLOUR OF THE SHIELD IN EARLY ARMORIAL BOOKPLATES SEE PP. . HE DIED IN . THE BOOKS CONTAINING THIS VERY PLEASING BOOKPLATE PASSED AFTER DE MALHERBES DEATH TO VINCENT DE BOYER IN WHOSE FAMILY THEY REMAINED TILL THE REVOLUTION AFTER THAT THEY WERE DISPERSED.  COMING TO LATER TIMES WE FIND A CHARMING BOOKPLATE ENGRAVED BY LE GRAND FOR THE UNFORTUNATE COUNTESS DUBARRY. HER BOOKS WERE WELL CHOSEN AND WELL BOUND BUT THEY WERE FEW IN NUMBER HENCE HER BOOKPLATE IS RARE BUT IT MAY BE SEEN IN THE LIBRARY AT VERSAILLES WHERE MOST OF HER BOOKS ARE PRESERVED. THOUGH SHE COULD NOT READ SHE SEEMS TO HAVE FELT IN DUTY BOUND TO FOLLOW LA POMPADOUR IN GETTING TOGETHER A LIBRARY TO AMUSE HER ROYAL MASTER.  FROM THE BOOKPLATE OF THE COUNTESSA WOMAN WHO AFTER AIDING IN THE GENERAL DEGRADATION OF THE FRENCH COURT WAS WILLING TO RISK HER LIFE FOR THOSE WHOSE DOWNFALL SHE HAD IN A MEASURE ASSISTED IN BRINGING ABOUTWE MAY APPROPRIATELY TURN TO THAT OF CARDINAL MAURY THE INSCRIPTION ON WHICH READS BIBLIOTHQUE PARTICULIRE DE SON EMINENCE MGR. LE CARDINAL MAURY. THIS BOOKPLATE CALLS TO MIND A FAMOUS FIGURE IN THE FRENCH REVOLUTIONA FERVENT PREACHER THE SPOKESMAN OF HIS FELLOWCLERGY BEFORE THOSE WHO WERE BUT LITTLE INCLINED TO LISTEN TO ARGUMENT THE CALMMINDED MAN WHO WOULD TURN ROUND AND GIVE A WITTY RETORT TO A CRY RAISED BY THE MOB WHICH FOLLOWED THROUGH THE STREETS OF PARIS CLAMOURING FOR HIS BLOOD.  THE MENTION OF THESE NAMES LEADS ONE NATURALLY TO SPEAK GENERALLY OF BOOKPLATES ENGRAVED ABOUT THE TIME OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTIONA PERIOD WHICH IS IMMORTALISED IN A SINGULAR MANNER ON FRENCH BOOKPLATES. M. POULET MALASSIS REMARKS THAT MANY A NOBLE LIBRARY OWNER TOOK GOOD CARE TO ALTER HIS BOOKPLATE IN THOSE TROUBLESOME TIMES AND TO REPLACE THE CORONET WHICH HAD SURMOUNTED THE FAMILY ESCUTCHEON BY THE PHRYGIAN CAP OF LIBERTY. FOR INSTANCE THE VISCOUNT DE BORBONBUSSET IN  CHANGED HIS ARMORIAL BOOKPLATE TO A SIMPLE INSCRIPTIONIN WHICH HE CALLS HIMSELF CITOYEN FRANOISSURROUNDED BY A LEAFY GARLAND. THE SAME FASHION IS EXEMPLIFIED EVEN IN CLERICAL EXAMPLES. FATHER LE MERCIER IN HIS FIRST BOOKPLATE DISPLAYS THE CORONET WHICH HE EITHER WAS OR AT LEAST CONSIDERED HIMSELF TO BE ENTITLED TO BEAR BUT BETWEEN  AND  WE FIND A SECOND EXAMPLE OF HIS BOOKPLATE WITH A SIMPLE DECORATIVE FINISH TO THE TOP OF THE DESIGN IN LIEU OF THE CORONET. AT THAT TIME THERE WAS IN FRANCE AS MR. WALTER HAMILTON PUTS IT AN AWKWARD FASHION OF PUTTING HEADS ACCUSTOMED TO CORONETS UNDER THE FALLING KNIFE OF THE GUILLOTINE.  AS FAR AS THE CLASSIFYING OF THE LEADING STYLES IN FRENCH BOOKPLATES GOES M. POULET MALASSIS DOES NOT REALLY HELP US MUCH AND WE CANNOT BUT HOPE THAT ERE LONG SOME ENTERPRISING FRENCH COLLECTOR WILL UNDERTAKE THE TASK. THERE IS CERTAINLY AS M. POULET MALASSIS OBSERVES A RESEMBLANCEAS THE READER WILL SEE BY TURNING BACK TO THE ILLUSTRATION OF DE MALHERBES BOOKPLATEBETWEEN THE STYLE OF THE FIRST FRENCH BOOKPLATES AND THAT OF THE FIRST ENGLISH AND IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT THE STYLE DISAPPEARED IN BOTH COUNTRIES MUCH AT THE SAME TIME. AGAIN FRENCH BOOKPLATES OF  BEAR DISTINCT TRACES OF WHAT WE HAVE CALLED JACOBEAN WORK IN SPEAKING OF ENGLISH EXAMPLES.  THE FRENCH ROCOCO BOOKPLATE IS REALLY ANALOGOUS TO OUR CHIPPENDALE. THERE IS HOWEVER A GREATER VARIETY BOTH OF SUBJECT AND TREATMENT IN EACH FRENCH STYLE THAN ONE FINDS IN ENGLAND.  ALLEGORY IS AS I STATED IN CHAPTER IV. MORE FREQUENT AND MORE WILD IN FRENCH BOOKPLATES THAN IN THOSE OF ENGLAND. THE FOLLIES OF HIS OWN COUNTRYMEN IN THIS RESPECT ARE FULLY RECOGNISED BY M. POULET MALASSIS WHO IN MOST AMUSING STYLE DEALS WITH SOME OF THE MORE PRONOUNCED EXAMPLES AS FOR INSTANCE THE ROLLICKING ALLEGORY DISPLAYED IN THE BOOKPLATE OF M. HNAULT PRESIDENT OF THE FRENCH ACADEMY. THE DATE OF THIS REMARKABLE PRODUCTION MAY BE FIXED AT  IT IS DESIGNED BY BOUCHER AND ENGRAVED BY COUNT DE CAYLUS AND WE SEE THAT MINERVA HAS HONOURED M. LE PRSIDENT BY PLACING HIS FAMILY ARMS UPON HER SHIELD. VERY WONDERFUL TOO IS THE BOOKPLATE OF THE ABB DE GRICOURT WHOSE ARMS ARE BORNE HEAVENWARDS BY A VAST COMPANY OF ANGELS. THIS EXAMPLE WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY OF THE SAME DATE AS THE LAST IS THE WORK OF THE ABBS BROTHER A. T. CEYS WHO WAS HIMSELF AN ECCLESIASTIC. OFTEN THE ALLEGORY DISPLAYED HAS ALLUSION TO THE OWNERS BUSINESS OR HIS TASTES AS ON THAT OF M. GUEULLETTE A FRENCH NOVELIST AND DRAMATIST OF THE FIRST HALF OF THE LAST CENTURY THE POPULARITY OF WHOSE WRITINGS ALTHOUGH THOSE WRITINGS ARE NUMEROUS HAS NOT OUTLIVED HIM. THIS BOOKPLATE IS THE WORK OF H. BECAT AND IS INSCRIBED AFTER THE PIRCKHEIMER MANNER EX LIBRIS THOM GUEULLETTE ET AMICORUM. THE FAMILY ARMS ARE SUPPORTED BY AN ITALIAN HARLEQUIN A CHINESE MANDARIN A CYCLOPS HOLDING AN INFANT AND A TARTAR. NOW THE PRESENCE OF THESE STRANGE INHABITANTS OF A BOOKPLATE IS ACCOUNTED FOR THUS. GUEULLETTE WROTE FARCES FOR THE PARIS STAGE AND HE ALSO WROTE CONTES TARTARES AND LES AVENTURES DU MANDARIN FUM HOAM. BELOW THE SHIELD WATER POURS FROM A SATYRS MOUTH INTO A BASIN CONTAINING A MERMAID AND ABOVE SOARS CUPID IN CLOUDS BEARING ALOFT A SCROLL AND MOTTO. THIS SAYS W. H. IN THE EX LIBRIS JOURNAL IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE EARLIEST BOOKPLATES ON WHICH APPEAR ALLEGORIC ALLUSIONS TO ITS OWNERS TASTES AND LITERARY LABOURS.  THE TYPICAL OR PERSONAL BOOKPLATE IS ALSO FOUND IN FRANCE IN THAT OF THE CHEVALIER DE FLEURIEU DESCRIBED BY MR. EGERTON CASTLE. DURING THE ANCIEN RGIME HE WAS A NAVAL OFFICER WHO WHILST STILL LOW IN THE SERVICE WAS INTRUSTED WITH THE TESTING OF VARIOUS NEW MARINE APPLIANCES. ON THE BOOKPLATE WE GET THE BIRDSEYE VIEW OF AN ISLAND ON WHICH ARE STREWN THE SAID MARINE APPLIANCES AND BEHIND THEM STANDS THE CHEVALIERS COAT OF ARMS.  A RECENT WRITER ON FRENCH BOOKPLATES M. HENRI BOUCHOT GOES SO FAR AS TO THINK A BOOKPLATE MAY BE OF SERVICE AS EXHIBITING A MANS CHARACTER. IT MAY BE SO WITH REGARD TO FRENCHMEN AND FRENCH BOOKPLATES BUT IF THIS PRINCIPLE OF ARGUMENT BE APPLIED TO ENGLISH BOOKPLATES ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT THE POSSESSORS OF ENGLISH BOOKPLATES IN THE CLOSING YEARS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY AND THE OPENING YEARS OF THE EIGHTEENTH MUST HAVE BEEN SINGULARLY ALIKE IN THEIR PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS  ILLUSTRATION  THE LIBRARY INTERIOR BOOKPLATE IS FOUND IN FRANCE AS EARLY AS  IN AN ANONYMOUS BOOKPLATE DESCRIBED BY MR. WALTER HAMILTON IN THE BOOK WORM FOR MAY . IT SHOWS US IN THE BACKGROUND OF A LIBRARY TWO MEN WORKING A PRINTINGPRESS. IN THE FOREGROUND ARE FIVE LITTLE WINGED CUPIDS AT PLAY WITH BOOKS AND MATHEMATICAL INSTRUMENTS WHILST A FEMALE FIGURE REPRESENTING PEACE AND PLENTY APPEARS SEATED ON WHAT MR. HAMILTON CONJECTURES TO BE A PEGASUS. THE ENGRAVING IS BY BERNARD PICART AN EMINENT ENGRAVER WHO THOUGH A FRENCHMAN BY BIRTH SETTLED AT AMSTERDAM IN  HE DIED IN  AND WAS EVIDENTLY MUCH INFLUENCED BY THE THEN PREVAILING STYLE IN DUTCH ART. HE EXECUTED ANOTHER VERY BEAUTIFUL LIBRARY INTERIOR PLATE FIGURED OPPOSITE FOR AMADEUS LULIN A SAVOYARD. HERE WE HAVE THE INTERIOR OF A FRENCH LIBRARY OF THE PERIOD WITH A CURVED ROOF. AT THE END OF THE ROOM IS A WINDOW AND BENEATH THIS A LOUIS XV. TABLE. IN THE FOREGROUND THE SAME CUPIDS PLAY WITH BOOKS WHICH BY THE WAY THEY ARE TREATING EXCEEDINGLY BADLY. CARYATIDES AT THE SIDES FORM A FRAME FOR THE PLATE. ON THE BREAST OF ONE IS A SUN THE OTHER HOLDS A HEART. A GLOBE SURMOUNTS EACH. THE ARMS ARE SHOWN IN THE CENTRE OF THE DESIGN AT THE TOP.  OTHER EXAMPLES OF FRENCH BOOKPLATES OF THIS KIND ARE FOUND QUITE LATE IN THE CENTURY AND ANY ONE WHO FEELS SPECIALLY INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT OF THESE AND INDEED OF LIBRARY INTERIOR BOOKPLATES AS A WHOLE WILL DO WELL TO STUDY SIR ARTHUR VICARSS VALUABLE TREATISE AND LISTS IN THE PAGES OF THE EX LIBRIS JOURNAL.  ABOUT THE BOOKPLATES OF COUNTRIES OTHER THAN GERMANY AND FRANCE THERE IS NOT VERY MUCH TO BE SAID. SWEDEN HAS GIVEN US AN INSIGHT INTO ITS NATIVE BOOKPLATES. HERR CARLANDER TELLS US THAT THE EARLIEST DATE ON A SWEDISH BOOKPLATE IS  WHICH OCCURS ON THAT BELONGING TO THURE BIELKE A SENATOR WHO HAVING MIXED HIMSELF UP IN POLITICAL STRIFE LOST HIS HEAD BY A STROKE OF THE EXECUTIONERS AXE FIVE YEARS LATER. SENATOR BIELKE WAS EVIDENTLY FAR IN ADVANCE OF HIS FELLOWCOUNTRYMEN AS REGARDS SUCH MATTERS FOR NO OTHER DATED SWEDISH BOOKPLATE OCCURS FOR A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF YEARS. IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY HOWEVER SWEDISH BOOKPLATES BECAME MUCH MORE NUMEROUS AND SOME OF THE MORE PROMINENT NATIVE ENGRAVERS APPEAR TO HAVE WORKED UPON THEM PRODUCING A FEW SINGULARLY FINE EXAMPLES IN THE ROCOCO STYLE LIBRARY INTERIORS ALSO APPEAR OCCASIONALLY ON SWEDISH BOOKPLATES. ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING LATE EXAMPLES OF BOOKPLATES OF THIS COUNTRY IS THAT OF KING CHARLES XIII. ON THIS WE HAVE THE ROYAL ARMS OF SWEDEN SURMOUNTED BY THE COLLAR AND CROSS OF THE ORDER OF THE SERAPHIM AND THE KINGS MOTTO FOLKETS WL MINT HOGSTA LAGTHE PEOPLES WEAL MY HIGHEST LAW. I IMAGINE THAT THIS BOOKPLATE MAY BE PLACED AT THE CLOSE OF THE LAST CENTURY. CHARLES DIED IN .  SWISS BOOKPLATES ARE NUMEROUS AND EARLY. THE FIRST DATED EXAMPLE OCCURS IN . THEIR GENERAL STYLE IS NOT PLEASING SINCE IT PRESENTS A STIFFNESS AND AWKWARDNESS IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE DECORATION. ITALIAN BOOKPLATES AGAIN POSSESS FEW REMARKABLE FEATURES. PERHAPS THEIR LEADING CHARACTERISTIC IS THE EXTREME COLDNESS OF THEIR ENGRAVERS TOUCH. ONE OF THESE ENGRAVERS WAS HOWEVER A FAMOUS MAN WHOSE WORK DESERVES MORE THAN PASSING MENTION. I MEAN RAPHAEL MORGHEN THE FLORENTINE ARTIST WHO DIED IN  AND WHO IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ENGRAVE A PLATE WHEN HE WAS ONLY TWELVE YEARS OLD. IT IS CURIOUS TO TURN FROM HIS LARGE ENGRAVINGS OF THE CHIEF WORKS IN THE GALLERY AT FLORENCE TO THE UNUSUALLY SMALL WORK WHICH ENABLES US TO RECKON HIM HERE AMONG THE ENGRAVERS OF BOOKPLATES. THIS IS A REPRESENTATION OF THE ARMS OF THE DUKE OF CASSANO SERRA FRAMED IN A SHELLY FRAME SOMEWHAT CHIPPENDALE IN APPEARANCE BUT WITH THE STIFF HEAVY JACOBEAN WREATH CLINGING CLOSELY TO IT. IN A SCROLL WHICH WINDS IN AND OUT OF THIS WREATH IS THE INSCRIPTION IL DUCA CASSANO SERRA IT IS SIGNED R. MORGHEN FECIT.  A CAREFUL INVESTIGATION OF THE VATICAN AND OTHER ITALIAN LIBRARIES WOULD PROBABLY LEAD TO THE DISCOVERY OF SOME MORE PAPAL BOOKPLATES. SIR WOLLASTON FRANKS TELLS ME THAT AMONGST HIS NUMEROUS ENGRAVINGS OF THE PAPAL ARMS THERE IS ONLY ONE WHICH HE FEELS SURE WAS EVER USED AS A BOOKPLATE. THE LATE SIR GEORGE DASENT IN NOTES AND QUERIES DESCRIBES WHAT HE CONSIDERS THE BOOKPLATE OF MAFFEO BARBERINI URBAN VIII. BUT HE DOES NOT TELL US WHAT LEADS HIM TO THE BELIEF THAT THE ENGRAVING IS REALLY A BOOKPLATE.  ABOUT SPANISH BOOKPLATES NOT MUCH IS YET KNOWN AND IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT THE MAJORITY OF EXAMPLES USUALLY CLASSED AS SPANISH WERE DESIGNED AND EXECUTED IN FLANDERS. THE FAMILY OF BOUTTATSTHE ORIGINAL BOUTTATS HAD SAYS WALPOLE TWENTY SONS OF WHOM TWELVE BECAME ENGRAVERSEXECUTED SOME OF THESE BOOKPLATES. AMONGST THEIR WORK IS ONE WHICH LORD DE TABLEY STYLES A GLOOMY YET STRIKING HERALDIC STUDY IT IS SIGNED P. B. BOUTTATS SCULP. AND WAS PROBABLY ENGRAVED ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY. IT SHOWS US THE ARMS OF A BISHOP SURMOUNTED BY A PLUMED HELMET ABOVE WHICH AGAIN IS A BISHOPS HAT WITH PENDENT ROPES AND TASSELS BENEATH IS THE MOTTO POR LA LE BEZERRA  POR EL RY. A PARTICULARLY FINE EXAMPLE OF FLEMISH HERALDIC ART IS FURNISHED BY THE BOOKPLATE ENGRAVED AND SIGNED BY J. HARREWYN OF BRUSSELS AND DATED  THE INSCRIPTION GIVES US QUITE A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH MESSIRE CHARLES BONAVENTURE COMTE VANDER NOOT BARON DE SCHOONHOVEN ET DE MARES CA CONSEILLER DE SA MATE IMPLE ET CATHE AU SOUVERAIN CONSEIL DE BRABANT PAR PATANTE DU  MARS  REU AUX ETATS NOBLES DE BRABANT FILS DE MESSIRE ROGIER WOUTHIER EN SON VIVANT BARON DE CARLOO CA ET DEPUTEZ ORDINAIRE AU DIT CORPS DE LA NOBLESSE DES ETATS DE BRABANT ET DE DAME ANNE LOUSE VANDER GRACHT NE BARONNE DE VREMPDE ET DOLMEN CA.  OUR KNOWLEDGE OF RUSSIAN OR POLISH BOOKPLATES IS CHIEFLY DERIVED FROM THE ILLUSTRATIONS SHOWN IN MONSIEUR S. J. SIENNICKIS WORK ENTITLED LES ELZEVIRS DE LA BIBLIOTHQUE DE LUNIVERSIT IMPRIALE DE VARSOVIE. HERE WE HAVE SOME EXAMPLES OF THE BOOKPLATES BOTH OF DISTINGUISHED LAYMEN AND ECCLESIASTICS. THE PROBABILITY IS THAT NONE ARE OF AN EARLY DATE AND THEY ARE CERTAINLY NOT CONSPICUOUS AS WORKS OF ART. THE RUSSIAN STYLE IS PERHAPS THE MORE DISTINCT THOUGH IN MANY RESPECTS RESEMBLING THE FRENCH ESPECIALLY THAT SHOWN IN THE MORE PRONOUNCED EXAMPLES OF THE LOUIS XV. EPOCH.

CHAPTER VIII  AMERICAN BOOKPLATES   WHATEVER AN AMERICAN COLLECTS HE COLLECTS WELL HE WORKS WITH A WILL AND ENERGY THAT LOOSENS HIS PURSESTRINGS IN A MANNER WHICH MAKES THE ACQUISITION OF VALUABLE SPECIMENS A COMPARATIVELY EASY MATTER. IT IS WELL THEREFORE THAT BOOKPLATE COLLECTING HAS FOUND ITS WAY OVER THE ATLANTIC AND THAT THERE IS NOW A GOODLY BODY OF AMERICAN BOOKPLATE COLLECTORS WHO ARE GIVING THE REQUISITE AMOUNT OF ATTENTION TO AMERICAN EXAMPLES AND WHO ARE NOT KEEPING TO THEMSELVES THE RESULT OF THEIR LABOURS. IN THE FIRST EDITION OF THIS BOOK I WROTE NO DOUBT TEN YEARS HENCE WE SHALL KNOW A GREAT DEAL MORE ABOUT AMERICAN BOOKPLATES AND ALREADY THE APPEARANCE OF MR. CHARLES DEXTER ALLENS INTERESTING AND CAREFULLY COMPOSED ACCOUNT OF THEM HAS ENABLED ME MATERIALLY TO IMPROVE THIS CHAPTER WHICH I HAVE DEVOTED TO THEM.  THE MAJORITY OF BOOKPLATES WHICH BEAR UPON THEM AMERICAN ADDRESSES ESPECIALLY THOSE BELONGING TO THE SOUTHERN STATES MANY OF WHICH APPEAR WITH THE OPENING OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY ARE WITHOUT DOUBT THE WORK OF ENGRAVERS IN THE THEN MOTHERCOUNTRY. THE LIBRARY OWNERS OF VIRGINIA SENT TO ENGLAND FOR THESE BOOKPLATES OR THEIR SONS ORDERED THEM THERE WHILST PAYING THE ORTHODOX VISIT TO ONE OF THE UNIVERSITIES AND BROUGHT THEM HOME EITHER FOR THEIR OWN USE OR FOR THE USE OF THEIR FATHERS. THE NORTHERN BOOKPLATES THOUGH MUCH LATER ARE MOSTLY THE WORK OF ARTISTS BORN AND BRED OR AT LEAST SETTLED IN AMERICA.  FOREMOST IN INTEREST AND EARLIEST IN DATE OF THESE AMERICAN ADDRESSPLATES IS THAT OF WILLIAM PENN ON WHICH HE STYLES HIMSELF PROPRIETOR OF PENSYLVANIA. THIS IS DESIGNED IN THE ORDINARY SIMPLE ARMORIAL STYLE THEN COMMON IN ENGLAND AND IS DATED IN . IT IS THEREFORE SUBSEQUENT TO PENNS LAST VISIT TO HIS PLANTATION AND CANNOT HAVE BEEN THE WORK OF AN ENGRAVER ON THAT SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC. AFTER HIS DEATH THE INSCRIPTION ON THIS BOOKPLATE WAS ALTERED FOR HIS SONS USE TO THOMAS PENN OF STOKE POGEIS IN THE COUNTY OF BUCKS FIRST PROPRIETOR OF PENSILVANIA SIC. THE EXPRESSION FIRST MUST HERE BE EVIDENTLY READ AS CHIEF OR PRINCIPAL. THE FACT OF THIS ALTERATION IS IMPORTANT FOR COLLECTORS TO NOTE AS COPIES OF WILLIAM PENNS BOOKPLATE ARE FREQUENTLY OFFERED FOR SALE WHICHTHEY ARE PALPABLY RECENT IMPRESSIONSARE SAID TO BE STRUCK FROM THE ORIGINAL PLATE A STATEMENT WHICH FROM THE FACT MENTIONED MAY BE AT ONCE DISCREDITED.  NEXT IN POINT OF DATE IS A MUCH MORE ORNATE BOOKPLATE THE INSCRIPTION ON WHICH READS WILLIAM BYRD OF WESTOVER IN VIRGINIA ESQUIRE. IT IS AN ELABORATE PIECE OF WORK EXCELLENTLY ENGRAVED IN THE STYLE OF THE MAJORITY OF ENGLISH BOOKPLATES OF  OR THEREABOUTS SIMPLE ARMORIAL BUT WITH INDICATIONS OF JACOBEAN DECORATION. WILLIAM BYRD WAS BORN IN VIRGINIA TH MARCH  HE WAS SENT TO ENGLAND TO BE EDUCATED AND RETURNED TO HIS NATIVE COUNTRY HAVING HIS MIND STORED WITH USEFUL INFORMATION TO ADORN ITS ANNALS HIS MANNERS CULTIVATED IN ROYAL COURTS AND WITH THIS BOOKPLATE AS A MARK OF HIS DEVOTION TO LITERATURE.  THE FAMOUS WESTOVER MANSION WHICH MAY TODAY BE VIEWED FROM THE JAMES RIVER TWO HOURS SAIL BELOW RICHMOND WAS FOR LONG THE VICEREGAL COURT OF VIRGINIA. IT WAS ERECTED ABOUT THE YEAR  BY WILLIAM BYRD WHO LEFT ENGLAND WHEN VERY YOUNG AND WAS FATHER TO HIS NAMESAKE WHOSE BOOKPLATE HAS JUST BEEN DESCRIBED THE AUTHOR OF THE FAMOUS WESTOVER MANUSCRIPTS COMPILED IN .  SOME FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE PROBABLE DATE OF THE BYRD BOOKPLATE WE HAVE NOTE OF THAT BELONGING TO ROBERT ELLISTON GENT. COMPTROLR OF HIS MAJESTIES CUSTOMS OF NEW YORK IN AMERICA MDCCXXV. THIS BOOKPLATE IS QUITE JACOBEAN IN STYLE AND WAS NO DOUBT EXECUTED IN ENGLAND AND SENT OUT TO THE COLONY. IT IS TOO FINE A PIECE OF WORK TO BE THE PRODUCTION OF ANY COLONIAL ENGRAVER OF THAT DATE.  BUT THE INTEREST ATTACHING TO BOOKPLATES BEARING UPON THEM AMERICAN ADDRESSES AND USED BY RESIDENTS IN AMERICA IS OBVIOUSLY NOT SO GREAT AS THAT AWAKENED BY EXAMPLES WHICH WERE ALSO ACTUALLY PRODUCED IN AMERICAEXAMPLES WHICH AT ONCE GIVE US AN INSIGHT INTO THE STATE OF THE ENGRAVERS ART AND OF THE ARTISTIC FEELING THEN EXISTING THERE.  THE EARLIEST OF THESE IS THE BOOKPLATE OF THE REV. JOHN WILLIAMS FIRST MINISTER OF DEERFIELD MASS. DATED IN . THE NEXT IN  THAT OF THOMAS PRINCE AN AMERICAN BORN AND BRED WHO GRADUATED FROM HARVARD COLLEGE IN  AND PAID HIS FIRST VISIT TO ENGLAND IN  SO THAT HIS BOOKPLATE MAY BE TAKEN AS GENUINELY AMERICAN. IN DESIGN IT RESEMBLES DOZENS OF ENGLISH EXAMPLESA ROUGH WOODCUT BORDER OF NATIONAL EMBLEMS WITHIN WHICH IS THE INSCRIPTION THOM PRINCE LIBER ANNO DOMINI  THE SEQUENCE OF THE WORDS IN THE INSCRIPTION THE READER WILL NOTICE BEING SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL. THE PRINCE LIBRARY WAS BEQUEATHED TO A SOCIETY WHICH BECAME KNOWN AS THE NEW ENGLAND LIBRARY AND WHICH ITSELF HAD A SIMILAR LABEL PREPARED RECORDING THE GIFT. A PART OF THE COLLECTION IS NOW IN THE BOSTON PUBLIC LIBRARY.  BUT THESE TWO EXAMPLES STAND BY THEMSELVES IT IS NOT UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THAT ANY NUMBER OF BOOKPLATES OF AMERICAN EXECUTION ARE FOUND AFTER THAT THERE ARE A REALLY CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY. THEIR STYLE IS NOT PARTICULARLY DISTINCTIVE IT IS AT FIRST EITHER JACOBEAN OR CHIPPENDALE OR A COMBINATION OF THE TWO STYLES LATER THE WREATH AND RIBBON AND LANDSCAPE AND PICTORIAL STYLES ARE INTRODUCED AND TREATED MUCH AS IN ENGLAND. IN EXECUTION AMERICAN BOOKPLATES ARE PERHAPS A TRIFLE COARSE. THE MORE PROMINENT OF THEIR ENGRAVERS SEEM TO HAVE BEENHURD DAWKINS ANDERSON JOHNSON CALLENDAR DOOLITTLE THE MAVERICKS REVERE AND TURNER. REVERE IS THE BEST KNOWN HE WAS A PICTURE ENGRAVER OF SOME MERIT BUT FOR THE MOST PART THE NAMES QUOTED ARE THOSE OF MEN OF LITTLE ARTISTIC REPUTATION. NATHANIEL HURD WAS PROBABLY THE EARLIEST OF THESE ENGRAVERS AND NOT THE WORST. HE WAS BORN AT BOSTON IN  THE SON OF AN AMERICAN WHO WAS A GOLDSMITH IN THAT TOWN. NATHANIEL WAS HIS FATHERS APPRENTICE HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO WORKING ON COPPER AND SO NATURALLY WOULD TURN HIS ATTENTION TO BOOKPLATES. PROBABLY THE EARLIEST EXAMPLE SIGNED BY HIM AS N. H. AND DATED IN  WAS DESIGNED FOR THOMAS DERING. THIS IS THE EARLIEST SIGNED AND DATED AMERICAN BOOKPLATE YET BROUGHT TO LIGHT HURD WAS BARELY TWENTY WHEN HE PRODUCED IT. AS A SEAL AND BOOKPLATE ENGRAVER HE WORKED HARD AND WELL HE DIED IN . ONE OF HIS MOST ORIGINAL BOOKPLATES IS THAT OF HARVARD COLLEGE. A CURIOUSLY SHORT AND WIDE SHIELD BEARING THE COLLEGE ARMS IS ENCIRCLED BY A BAND BEARING THE INSCRIPTION SIGILL. COLL. HARVARD. CANTAB. NOV. ANGL. . OUTSIDE THIS CIRCLE ARE TWO LEAF SPRAYS TIED AT THE BASE AND NEARLY MEETING AT THE TOP. BOTH IN CONCEPTION AND EXECUTION THIS IS A VERY PECULIAR BOOKPLATE. THE DERING PLATE ON THE OTHER HAND IS INTERESTING AS SHOWING HOW EXACTLY THE STYLE OF THE MOTHERCOUNTRY AT THAT PERIOD WAS COPIED IN AMERICA. HERE WE HAVE A PURE CHIPPENDALE BOOKPLATE OF AN UNPRONOUNCED TYPE.  HENRY DAWKINS WHO BEGAN LIFE BY DESIGNING METAL BUTTONS HAD BEEN FOR A LONG TIME RESIDENT IN AMERICA WHEN IN  HE ENGRAVED THE BOOKPLATE OF JOHN BURNET OF NEW YORK. LIKE THE DERING PLATE BURNETS IS INTERESTING AND FOR THE SAME REASON IT IS CHIPPENDALE BUT DISTINCTLY LATER CHIPPENDALE WITH CUPIDS AND OTHER FIGURES INTRODUCED. DAWKINS WAS FOUND GUILTY OF COUNTERFEITING AND BEGGED TO BE HANGED RATHER THAN SUFFER THE IMPRISONMENT TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN CONDEMNED. WHETHER OR NOT HIS REQUEST WAS GRANTED WE DO NOT KNOW.  THAT THE HERALDRY ON SOME OF THESE AMERICAN BOOKPLATES SHOULD BE STARTLING IS ONLY TO BE EXPECTED. TAKE FOR INSTANCE THE VERY INTERESTING BOOKPLATE OF ROBERT DINWIDDIE DEPUTYGOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA FROM  WHICH WAS PROBABLY ENGRAVED A FEW YEARS BEFORE THE EARLIER DATE. HERE WE HAVE THE SHIELD DIVIDED FESSEFASHION AND IN THE UPPER AND LOWER DIVISIONS LANDSCAPESTHE FIRST INTRODUCING AN INDIAN ARCHER SHOOTING AT A STAG AND THE LOWER A FORT OR CASTLE WITH A SHIP AT SEA SAILING TOWARDS IT. DINWIDDIE WAS A GOOD SERVANT TO THE ENGLISH CROWN BOTH IN BARBADOES AND VIRGINIA AND IS SAID LIKE MOST SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE OF HIS DAY TO BE DESCENDED FROM AN ANCIENT FAMILY THOUGH HIS IMMEDIATE ANCESTORS WERE GLASGOW MERCHANTS. WE ARE HOWEVER NOT ASKED TO BELIEVE AND WE SHOULD NOT IF WE WERE THAT THE ARMS ARE MORE ANCIENT THAN GOVERNOR DINWIDDIE HIMSELF OR THAT THEY ORIGINATED ELSEWHERE THAN IN HIS MERCANTILE BRAIN THOUGH THEY MAY HAVE BEEN LEGALLY GRANTED BY THE SCOTCH COLLEGE OF ARMS. THE PLATE LOOKS SCOTCHIT IS CHIPPENDALE AND I SUSPECT WAS ENGRAVED IN THE MOTHERCOUNTRY BY A SCOTCH ENGRAVER. WE MAY DATE IT ABOUT .  THERE ARE OF COURSE SOME AMERICAN BOOKPLATES SPECIALLY INTERESTING FROM THEIR POSSESSORS AND FOREMOST AMONGST THEM IS THAT OF GEORGE WASHINGTON. FOR ITS DESCRIPTION I CANNOT DO BETTER THAN QUOTE MR. ALLEN THE ARMS ARE DISPLAYED UPON A SHIELD OF THE USUAL SHELLLIKE FORM AND THE SPRAYS AND ROSEBRANCHES OF THIS STYLE CHIPPENDALE ARE USED IN THE ORNAMENTATION OF THE SIDES OF THE ESCUTCHEON. THE MOTTO EXITUS ACTA PROBAT IS GIVEN UPON ITS RIBBON AT THE BASE OF THE SHIELD AND THE NAME IS ENGRAVED IN SCRIPT ON THE BRACKET AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DESIGN. IN GENERAL APPEARANCE THE PLATE IS LIKE SCORES OF CHIPPENDALE PLATES OF THE PERIOD. I AM SORRY TO TAKE SOMEWHAT FROM THE INTEREST WHICH ATTACHES TO THIS BOOKPLATE BY SAYING THAT AS I LOOK MORE CLOSELY INTO IT AND STUDY THE DETAILS OF ITS ORNAMENTATION AND ITS EXECUTION I AM CONVINCED IT WAS ENGRAVED IN ENGLAND AND NOT IN AMERICA IT MUST THEREFORE BE OF AN EARLIER DATE THAN THAT ATTRIBUTED TO IT. I DO NOT THINK IT IS SUBSEQUENT TO . OF COURSE THERE IS A FORGERY OF THIS PLATE THOUGH IT WAS PREPARED NOT BECAUSE OF THE VALUE OF THE BOOKPLATE BUT TO SELL A NUMBER OF BOOKS WHICH WERE SAID TO HAVE BELONGED TO GEORGE WASHINGTON HIMSELF AND TO HAVE BEEN CAPTURED IN VIRGINIA. THE FRAUD WAS HOWEVER DISCOVERED. NO DOUBT THESE FORGERIES ARE NOW PALMED OFF AS THE GREAT MANS BOOKPLATE. MR. LICHTENSTEINS WORDS ABOUT THE REAL BOOKPLATE AND THE SHAM ARE THEREFORE IMPORTANT  ORIGINAL EXAMPLES ARE NOTICEABLE FOR THEIR SHARP BLACK IMPRESSIONS ON DAMPENED PLATE PAPER OF A BUFF COLOUR MELLOWED BY AGE. THOSE OF THE IMITATION ARE PRINTED FROM A PLATE WHICH HAS THE APPEARANCE OF HAVING SEEN CONSIDERABLE WEAR BESIDES BEING PRINTED ON A DRY PAPER OF A THIN QUALITY AND A BLUISH COLOUR BY ITS MODERN APPEARANCE IT IS EASILY RECOGNISED THE ENGRAVING OF THE NAME BEING POORLY DONE.  I DO NOT KNOW IF A SERIES OF PRESIDENTS BOOKPLATES COULD BE SHOWN TO EXIST BUT WASHINGTONS SUCCESSOR JOHN ADAMS CERTAINLY USED ONE INTRODUCING INTO IT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF NATIONAL EMBLEMS. THE AMERICAN EAGLE WITH OUTSPREAD WINGS OVERSHADOWS THE WHOLE DESIGN.  OF AMERICAN WOMEN IN THE EARLY DAYS OF INDEPENDENCE ONLY ONE IS KNOWN TO HAVE USED A BOOKPLATE. THIS LADY WAS ELIZABETH GRME THE YOUNGEST CHILD OF DR. THOMAS GRME MEMBER OF THE PROVINCIAL COUNCIL AND IN OTHER WAYS A DISTINGUISHED AND WEALTHY CITIZEN WHO OWNED GRME PARK AN ESTATE LYING SOME TWENTY MILES FROM PHILADELPHIA. ELIZABETH WAS BORN IN . AT SEVENTEEN SHE WAS ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED BUT HER ENGAGEMENT WAS SUDDENLYWHY WE LEARN NOTBROKEN OFF. TO DIVERT HER MIND SHE SET TO WORK TO TRANSLATE TLMAQUE. SHE CARRIED OUT THE TASK BUT IT WAS NEVER PUBLISHED AND LIES TODAY AS SHE WROTE IT IN THE PHILADELPHIA MUSEUM. HER NEXT ENGAGEMENT WAS TO A MAN TEN YEARS HER JUNIORA MR. FERGUSON HIM SHE MARRIED BUT HER HUSBAND TAKING THE CROWNS PART THEY SEPARATED. BY THE TIME OF HER DEATH IN  SHE HAD GROWN NEEDY DESPITE THE FACT THAT SHE RECEIVED MONEY FROM HER LITERARY PRODUCTIONS WHICH WERE NUMEROUS. THOUGH EVIDENTLY A STAUNCH REPUBLICAN SHE WAS THE BEARER OF THE FAMOUS LETTER FROM THE REV. JACOB DUCH TO WASHINGTON IN WHICH THE WRITER BEGGED HIS CORRESPONDENT TO RETURN TO HIS ALLEGIANCE TO THE KING. THE BOOKPLATE WHICH IS IN EVERY WAY CURIOUS AND INTERESTING IS ARMORIAL.  AN INTERESTING POINT ABOUT AMERICAN BOOKPLATESWHICH ILLUSTRATES A DISTINCTIVE FEATURE IN SOCIAL LIFE THEREIS THE EXISTENCE OF A LARGE NUMBER BELONGING TO FRIENDLY SOCIETIES MUTUAL IMPROVEMENT SOCIETIES AND INSTITUTIONS AKIN TO THEM FOR THE BOOKS FORMING THE LIBRARIES OF THESE BODIES CONTAIN SOME OF THE MOST CURIOUS AND CHARACTERISTIC AMERICAN BOOKPLATES. AMONGST THE NUMBER MAY BE MENTIONED THOSE OF THE NEW YORK SOCIETY LIBRARY THE FARMINGTON LIBRARY THE HASTY PUDDING SOCIETY AND THE PORCELLIAN CLUB IN HARVARD COLLEGE THE LINONIAN SOCIETY AND THE BROTHERS OF UNITY IN YALE AND THE SOCIAL FRIENDS IN DARTMOUTH COLLEGE.  NONE OF THESE ARE PARTICULARLY EARLY INDEED THE MAJORITY MUST BE DATED AFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF INDEPENDENCE BUT THEY ARE WELL WORTHY OF STUDY. ALLEGORY RUNS WILD IN THE BOOKPLATESTHERE ARE THREE MENTIONED BY MR. DEXTER ALLENOF THE FIRSTNAMED SOCIETY AND MINERVA IS PROMINENT IN ALL. LET ME ENDEAVOUR TO DESCRIBE TWO BOTH THE WORK OF MAVERICK. IN ONE SHE HANDS A VOLUME OF THE SOCIETYS LIBRARY TO AN INDIAN WHOSE ATTITUDE IN RECEIVING IT SUGGESTS THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN A BOOK BEFORE IN WHICH CASE ITS CONTENTS CANNOT HAVE DONE HIM MUCH GOOD. IN THE OTHER SHE HAS JUST DESCENDED FROM OLYMPUS ENTERED THE LIBRARY AND SEIZED A VOLUME FROM THE BOOKSHELF WHICH SHE PRESENTS TO AN APPARENTLY MORE APPRECIATIVE REDSKIN. I SAY APPRECIATIVE FOR IN RETURN HE HANDS THE GODDESS HIS TOMAHAWK. MINERVA WITH A TOMAHAWK CAN ANYTHING BE MORE DELIGHTFULLY ABSURD  ONE MIGHT GO ON WITH MANY PAGES OF THESE DESCRIPTIONS BUT ENOUGH HAS BEEN SAID TO SHOW THE BURLESQUE SPIRIT IN WHICH ALLEGORY IS TREATED DOUBTLESS QUITE UNINTENTIONALLY ON AMERICAN SOCIETY BOOKPLATES. IN THAT FACT LIES MUCH OF THEIR INTEREST. MORE HAPPY IN CONCEPTION AND EXECUTION IS THE HOMELIER DESIGN APPEARING ON THE BOOKPLATE OF THE VILLAGE LIBRARY IN FARMINGTON WHICH IF NOT A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF ENGRAVING IS AT LEAST FREE FROM GROTESQUENESS.  IN THIS SAYS MR. ALLEN WE SEE THE INTERIOR OF A ROOM IN WHICH A YOUNG LADY PATRON OF THE LIBRARY IS STORING HER MIND WITH THOSE CHOICE AXIOMS WHICH IF PUT IN PRACTICE FAR EXCEED THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF MERE PERSONAL BEAUTY SO SAYS THE COUPLET BENEATH THE PICTURE      BEAUTIES IN VAIN THEIR PRETTY EYES MAY ROLL      CHARMS STRIKE THE SENSE BUT MERIT WINS THE SOUL.  A WRITER IN THE EX LIBRIS JOURNAL POINTS OUT THAT AFTER THE REVOLUTION TILL ABOUT THE YEAR  THERE WERE SCARCELY ANY AMERICAN ARMORIAL BOOKPLATES. PERHAPS ONE OF THE EARLIEST IS THAT OF SAMUEL ELAM RHODE ISLAND WHICH APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN ENGRAVED ABOUT . IT IS PICTORIAL IN STYLE AND SHOWS A SHIELD BEARING ARMS RESTING AGAINST A TREESTUMP WITH A LANDSCAPE BACKGROUND. THE MAJORITY OF AMERICAN BOOKPLATE POSSESSORS FROM  UNTIL THE FASHION OF USING A BOOKPLATE BECAME COMMON SOME LITTLE TIME BACK SEEM TO HAVE BEEN MEMBERS OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION.  DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS MANY AMERICAN BOOKPLATES HAVE BEEN AS WILD AND MEANINGLESS IN DESIGN AS THE MAJORITY OF THOSE RECENTLY PRODUCED IN ENGLAND ALTHOUGH AS MR. ALLENS ILLUSTRATIONS SHOW US A FEW TRULY ARTISTIC AND APPROPRIATE EXAMPLES HAVE APPEARED. ONE MODERN BOOKPLATE FROM ACROSS THE ATLANTIC IS SURE TO ATTRACT ENGLISH EYES FOR THE OWNERS WORKS ARE READ AS EAGERLY AND APPRECIATED AS FULLY HERE AS IN THE STATESI MEAN THAT OF OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES. THIS TOO IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE MAN CONSISTING SIMPLY OF A MOTTOSCROLL ON WHICH IS WRITTEN PER AMPLIORA AD ALTIORA AND A NAUTILUSTHE SHIP OF PEARL AS HE CALLS IT THE VENTUROUS BARK THAT FLINGS      ON THE SWEET SUMMER WINDS ITS PURPLED WINGS      IN GULFS ENCHANTED WHERE THE SIREN SINGS      AND CORAL REEFS LIE BARE      WHERE THE COLD SEA MAIDS RISE TO SUN THEIR STREAMING HAIR.  FOOTNOTES   AMERICAN BOOKPLATES. BY CHARLES DEXTER ALLEN. BELL AND SON .   THE SAME REMARK APPLIES TO OTHER BOOKPLATES BEARING COLONIAL ADDRESSES SUCH AS THAT OF ISAAC ROYALL ESQ. OF ANTIGUA.   IT MAY BE REMARKED AS CURIOUS THAT WILLIAM PENN DOES NOT ON HIS BOOKPLATE IMPALE THE ARMS OF HANNAH CALLOWHILL TO WHOM HE WAS MARRIED IN .     CHAPTER IX  INSCRIPTIONS ON BOOKPLATES IN CONDEMNATION OF BOOKSTEALING OR BOOKSPOILING AND IN PRAISE OF STUDY   I PROPOSE NOW TO SPEAK ABOUT THE INSCRIPTIONS ON BOOKPLATES AND I WILL DIVIDE THEM AS FOLLOWS SENTIMENTS IN CONDEMNATION OF BOOKSTEALING OR BOOKSPOILING  SENTIMENTS IN PRAISE OF BOOKS OR OF STUDY AND  PERSONAL PARTICULARS OF THE OWNER OF THE BOOKPLATE WHICH LAST CLASS SHALL RECEIVE ATTENTION IN A SEPARATE CHAPTER. IN ALL THREE CASES ILLUSTRATIONS MAY BE APPROPRIATELY DRAWN BOTH FROM ENGLISH AND FOREIGN EXAMPLES.  LET ME BEGIN BY CALLING THE READERS ATTENTION TO THE FACT WHICH I COMMENTED UPON IN MY FIRST CHAPTER THAT IN NEARLY ALL INSCRIPTIONS ON BOOKPLATES IT IS THE VOLUME IN WHICH THE BOOKPLATE IS PLACED AND NOT THE BOOKPLATE ITSELF THAT IS SPOKESMAN. TAKE THE INSCRIPTION ON ONE OF THE EARLIEST EXAMPLES LIBER BILIBALDI PIRCKHEIMER SIBI ET AMICIS. BILIBALD PIRCKHEIMERS BOOK FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FRIENDS HERE IS AN AMIABLE INTENTION BUT THE PLAN DID NOT WORK AND WE DO NOT FIND THE SENTIMENT OFTEN REPEATED. IN THE GOOD JURISTS DAY PRINTED BOOKS WERE NOT NUMEROUS AND THEY WERE COSTLY. THEN MIGHT A MAN BE REASONABLY REGARDED AS A DOG IN THE MANGER WHO SHUT THE DOOR OF HIS BOOKCASE AGAINST THOSE ANXIOUS TO BENEFIT BY THE WORK OF THE PRINTINGPRESS THEN MANKIND AT LARGE HAD NOT DEMONSTRATED THE FACT THAT GENERAL MORALITY DOES NOT EXTEND TO RETURNING BORROWED BOOKS. HENCE I SAY IT WAS THAT ON THIS EARLY BOOKPLATE WE HAVE THE EXPRESSION SIBI ET AMICIS.  SCHOOLBOYSAND I DARE SAY IF ONE COULD ONLY LEARN THE TRUTH IN SUCH MATTERS SCHOOLGIRLS TOOHAVE A HABIT OF INSCRIBING THEIR SCHOOLBOOKS WITH VERSES DENOUNCING IN DECIDEDLY FORCIBLE LANGUAGE THE SCHOOLFELLOW WHO STEALSI.E. BORROWS AND FORGETS TO RETURNANY PARTICULAR VOLUME AND AT THE END OF THESE VERSES IS DEPICTED A GALLOWS FROM WHICH HANGS THE LIFELESS BODY OF THE THIEF. WHEN DID SCHOOLBOYS FIRST THUS PROTECT THEIR POSSESSIONS FEW SCHOOLBOOKS SURVIVE FOR USE BY MANY SUCCESSIVE GENERATIONS SO WE HAVE NO MEANS OF ANSWERING THE QUESTION SATISFACTORILY BUT IN A BOOKNOT A SCHOOLBOOKPUBLISHED IN  THERE ARE WRITTEN SO A CORRESPONDENT OF NOTES AND QUERIES INFORMS US IN WRITING MORE THAN THREE CENTURIES OLD THESE LINES BELOW THE OWNERS SIGNATURE      MY MASTERS NAME ABOVE YOU SE      TAKE HEEDE THEREFORE YOU STEALE NOT MEE      FOR IF YOU DOE WITHOUT DELAY      YOUR NECKE . . . FOR ME SHALL PAY.      LOOKE DOUNE BELOW AND YOU SHAL SEE      THE PICTURE OF THE GALLOWSTREE      TAKE HEEDE THEREFORE OF THYS IN TIME      LEST ON THIS TREE YOU HIGHLY CLIME.          DRAWING OF THE GALLOWS.  SO THE SCHOOLBOYS DOGGEREL IS AT LEAST FOUNDED ON AN ANCIENT MODEL WHICH WE HAVE QUOTED THOUGH NOT ACTUALLY APPEARING ON A BOOKPLATE BECAUSE IT WAS CLEARLY INTENDED TO DO DUTY AS ONE.  OF EXACTLY THE SAME DATE IS A VERY POMPOUS DECLARATION ON A GERMAN BOOKPLATE OF A DONORS INTENTION THAT CERTAIN VOLUMES GIVEN BY HIM SHOULD REMAIN FOR EVER IN THE LIBRARY TO WHICH THEY ARE PRESENTED. THE OWNER OF THE BOOKPLATE WAS JOHN FABER BISHOP OF VIENNA WHO DIED IN  AND WHO IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR PRESENTED HIS BOOKS TO THE COLLEGE OF ST. NICHOLAS IN THAT CITY. HERE IS A TRANSLATION GIVEN BY LORD DE TABLEY IN WHICH MARK HOW IN KINGLY FASHION THE BISHOP REFERS TO HIMSELF AS WE  THIS BOOK WAS BOUGHT BY US DR. JOHN FABER BISHOP OF VIENNA AND ASSISTANT IN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE NEW STATE BOTH AS COUNCILLOR AND CONFESSOR TO THE MOST GLORIOUS CLEMENT AND PIOUS FERDINAND KING OF THE ROMANS HUNGARY AND BOHEMIA AND ARCHDUKE OF AUSTRIA. AND SINCE INDEED THAT MONEY WHICH PURCHASED THIS VOLUME DID NOT ARISE FROM THE REVENUES AND PROPERTIES OF OUR DIOCESE BUT FROM OUR OWN MOST HONEST LABOURS IN OTHER DIRECTIONS. AND THEREFORE IT IS FREE TO US TO GIVE OR BEQUEATH THE BOOK TO WHOMSOEVER WE PLEASE. WE ACCORDINGLY PRESENT IT TO OUR COLLEGE OF ST. NICHOLAS. AND WE ORDAIN THAT THIS VOLUME SHALL REMAIN THERE FOR EVER FOR THE USE OF THE STUDENTS ACCORDING TO OUR ORDER AND DECREE. DONE IN OUR EPISCOPAL COURT AT VIENNA ON THE FIRST DAY OF SEPTEMBER IN THE YEAR OF GRACE .  ILLUSTRATION  DR. FABER WAS FAMOUS FOR HIS ORTHODOXY AND HIS FERVOUR IN ENFORCING IT SO MUCH SO THAT HE EARNED FOR HIMSELF THE TITLE MALLEUS HERETICORUM. HE DOES NOT TRUST HIMSELF TO EXPRESS HIS OPINION OF THE TOO EAGER STUDENT WHO SHOULD TAKE TO HIMSELF A VOLUME FROM AMONGST THESE BOOKS WHICH IS PERHAPS WELL.  MORE POLITE THAN THE ENGLISH VERSES OF  AND THEREFORE NOT HALF SO SERVICEABLE ARE THOSE PRINTED ON AN ACTUAL BOOKPLATE BY WHICH ANDREW HEDIO A KNIGSBERG PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY WHO LIVED ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY SOUGHT TO INSURE THE SAFE RETURN TO HIS LIBRARY OF ANY VOLUME WHICH WAS OUT ON LOAN. THE ARMS OF HEDIOTHE HEAD AND SHOULDERS OF AN OLD BEARDED MAN IN A FISHTAILED NIGHTCAPAPPEAR ON THE BOOKPLATE AND BELOW SUPPOSED TO BE SPOKEN BY THE VOLUME ARE LATIN VERSES WHICH IN FREE TRANSLATION MAY BE RENDERED      BY HIM WHO BOUGHT ME FOR HIS OWN      IM LENT FOR READING LEAF BY LEAF      IF HONEST YOULL RETURN THE LOAN      IF YOU RETAIN ME YOURE A THIEF.  IF YOU TURN BACK TO P.  AND LOOK AT THE BOOKPLATE OF SPERATUS YOU WILL SEE THAT HE HAD EXPRESSED VERY MUCH THIS SENTIMENT MORE THAN A CENTURY BEFORE.  IT IS NOT TILL THE BEGINNING OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THAT WE FIND ANY DECIDED EXPRESSION OF POSSESSION ON AN ENGLISH BOOKPLATE. THEN IT OCCURS ON THAT OF JOHN REILLY DESCRIBED ON P. . AT THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE DESIGN IS PRINTED CLAMABUNT OMNES TE LIBER ESSE MEUM. HERE YOU SEE IT IS JOHN REILLY HIMSELF AND NOT HIS BOOK THAT SPEAKS. IT IS A MILD AND DECIDEDLY GENTLEMANLY WAY OF EXPRESSING OWNERSHIP FREE FROM THREATS FOR NOT RETURNING THE VOLUME INDEED HARDLY CONTEMPLATING THE POSSIBILITY OF SO DISHONEST AN ACT.  ABOUT THE SAME DATE AS REILLYS BOOKPLATE IS A VERY GRACEFUL GERMAN ONE EXECUTED FOR MICHAEL LILIENTHAL FIGURED ON P. . IT SHOWS US A GROUP OF GROWING LILIES AROUND WHICH BEES ARE HOVERING OR TASTING THEIR SWEETNESS AND BELOW      USE THE BOOK BUT LET NO ONE MISUSE IT      THE BEE DOES NOT STAIN THE LILIES BUT ONLY TOUCHES THEM.  FROM THIS GRACEFUL BOOKPLATE AND THE PLEASANTRY OF ITS INSCRIPTION WE TURN TO A HEAVY DECLAMATORY SENTENCE DEVISED CIRCA  BY THE LIBRARIAN OF THE BENEDICTINE MONASTERY OF WESSENBRUN IN BAVARIA FOR THE BOOKS IN HIS CHARGE TO SPEAK WHEN A THEFT HAD BEEN ACTUALLY COMMITTED OR WAS IN CONTEMPLATION I AM THE RIGHTFUL POSSESSION OF THE CLOISTER OF WESSENBRUN. HO THERE RESTORE ME TO MY MASTER SO RIGHT DEMANDS  SHERLOCK WILLIS WHOSE BOOKPLATEA DECIDED CHIPPENDALEIS DATED IN  FLIES TO SCRIPTURE FOR HIS AID AGAINST IMMORAL BORROWERS AND PLACES ON HIS BOOKPLATE THE FAMILIAR QUOTATION FROM THE TH PSALM THE UNGODLY BORROWETH AND PAYETH NOT AGAIN. VARIOUS OTHER ENGLISH BOOKPLATES BEAR THE SAME QUOTATION OR SOME OTHER TAKEN FROM THE BIBLE. ON THAT IN USE AT THE PAROCHIAL LIBRARY OF TADCASTER WHICH SHOWS US ST. JOHN IN THE ISLE OF PATMOS RECEIVING FROM THE ANGEL THE BOOK WHICH HE WAS TO EAT WE READ ACCIPE LIBRUM ET DEVORA ILLUM REV. X.  ADVICE WHICH IT WAS NOT WE MAY PRESUME INTENDED THAT THE BORROWER SHOULD FOLLOW LITERALLY.  THERE IS SOMETHING VERY BUSINESSLIKE AND TO THE POINT ABOUT THE INSCRIPTION ON THE BOOKPLATE OF CHARLES FERDINAND HOMMEAU WHICH IS DATED SIX YEARS AFTER THAT OF SHERLOCK WILLIS. THE INSCRIPTION READS IN TRANSLATION IF YOU DO NOT RETURN THE LOAN WITHIN FOURTEEN DAYS OR DO NOT KEEP IT CAREFULLY ON ANOTHER OCCASION WHEN YOU ASK TO BORROW IT OR SOME OTHER BOOK I SHALL SAY I HAVE NOT GOT IT. SO M. HOMMEAU WILL NOT MIND TELLING A LIE TO PROTECT HIS LIBRARY AND WHAT IS MORE DOES NOT MIND TELLING THE WORLD OF HIS INTENTION TO DO SO. TRULY HE WAS AN HONEST LIAR.  DAVID GARRICK WHOSE BOOKPLATE IS FIGURED OPPOSITE SELECTED AS AN APPROPRIATE QUOTATION FOR HIS BOOKPLATE THE FOLLOWING TAKEN FROM THE FOURTH VOLUME OF MENAGIANALA PREMIRE CHOSE QUON DOIT FAIRE QUAND ON A EMPRUNT UN LIVRE CEST DE LE LIRE AFIN DE POUVOIR LE RENDRE PLUTT. VERY GOOD ADVICE NO DOUBT BUT I WONDER IF DAVY WAS CAREFUL ENOUGH TO CONFINE HIS LOANS TO THOSE WHO WOULD FOLLOW IT THIS REMINDS ME OF A VERY NICELY PUT PASSAGE OF LORD DE TABLEYS  PROPOS OF THE SUBJECT OF BOOKBORROWING IN GENERAL  ILLUSTRATION  NOW THIS BATCH OF MOTTOES RAISES THE POINT WHETHER VALUABLE BOOKS SHOULD BE LENT TO PERSONS WHO TREAT VOLUMES LIKE COAL SCUTTLES WHO PERPETRATE SUCH ATROCITIES AS MOISTENING THEIR THUMBS TO TURN A PAGE OVER WHO HOLD A FINE BINDING BEFORE A ROARING FIRE WHO HORRIBILE DICTU READ AT BREAKFAST AND USE AS A BOOKMARKER THE BUTTERKNIFE. OUGHT GARRICK TO HAVE LENT THE CREAM OF HIS SHAKESPEARE QUARTOS TO SLOVENLY AND MOLEEYED SAMUEL JOHNSON WE THINK EMPHATICALLY NOT MANY FULLGROWN FOLKS HAVE NO MORE IDEA OF HANDLING A BOOK THAN HAS A SCHOOLBOY.  SO FAR THE CAVEATS ON BOOKPLATES HAVE BEEN EITHER ORIGINAL COMPOSITIONS OR QUOTATIONS SPECIALLY SELECTED BY THE OWNER BUT AS TIME WENT ON PEOPLE DID NOT TROUBLE TO COMPOSE THEIR OWN VERSES OR INSCRIPTIONS OR TO HUNT UP APPROPRIATE QUOTATIONS. THE SAME LINES OR WORDS APPEAR FASTENED BENEATH OR PRINTED UPON THE BOOKPLATES OF MANY DIFFERENT PERSONS IN THE LATTER CASE THE BOOKPLATE IS GENERALLY LITTLE MORE THAN A NAME TICKET. HERE IS ONE COMPOSED EARLY IN THIS CENTURY WHICH COULD BE BOUGHT OF C.

IN THESE LAST QUOTED EXAMPLES ARE CERTAINLY MANY STIPULATIONS BUT THEY ARE AS NOUGHT WHEN COMPARED WITH WHAT WE FIND ON THE BOOKPLATE OF THE CAVALIER FRANCESCO VARGAS MACCIUCCA WHO WAS IN THE HABIT OF PASTING ON THE FLYLEAF OF THE BOOK OPPOSITE HIS BOOKPLATE FIFTEEN RULES WRITTEN IN LATIN TO BE OBSERVED BY THOSE WHO BORROWED BOOKS FROM HIS LIBRARY. IF HE ENFORCED THEM HE CAN HAVE BEEN SELDOM TROUBLED WITH A BORROWER  ON THE FACE OF THEMSINCE MOST OF THEM HAVE A BLANK SPACE LEFT FOR THE OWNERS NAME ETC.THESE POETIC OR PROSAIC THREATS AGAINST BOOKSTEALERS AND THE ILLUSAGE OF BOOKS DO NOT PRETEND TO BE THE COMPOSITIONS OF THOSE THAT USED THEM. JONES OR BROWN WENT TO THE NEAREST STATIONER OR BOOKSELLER AND PURCHASED HIS ADMONITIONS ALL READY COMPOSED. BUT EVEN AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF READYMADE ADMONITIONS WE FIND THE MAN OF INDEPENDENT MIND REBELLING AGAINST SAVING HIS LIBRARY FROM SPOLIATION BY ANYBODYS WORDS SAVE HIS OWN. SUCH A PERSON WAS MR. CHARLES CLARK OF GREAT TOTHAM HALL NEAR WITHAM IN ESSEX WHO CAN AT LEAST CLAIM ORIGINALITY FOR HIS COMPOSITION WHICH IF LENGTHY HAS OCCASIONAL GLEAMS OF HUMOUR.

A CERTAIN CHESHIRE CLERGYMAN WHO DIED NOT VERY LONG SINCE SOUGHT EUPHONY IN A STRING OF COMMANDS TO INTENDING BORROWERS WHICH HE HAD PRINTED ON HIS BOOKPLATE BORROW BRAVELY KEEP CAREFULLY PERUSE PATIENTLY RETURN RIGHTEOUSLY. WHAT A PITY HE DID NOT SPELL CAREFULLY WITH A K WHILST HE WAS ABOUT IT  THE PLYMOUTH ARCHITECT AND AUTHOR GEORGE WIGHTWICK OR AS HE EVIDENTLY PRONOUNCED IT WITICK USED TO AFFIX IN HIS BOOKS      TO WHOMSOEVER THIS BOOK I LEND       I GIVE ONE WORDNO MORE     THEY WHO TO BORROW CONDESCEND       SHOULD GRACIOUSLY RESTORE.

CHARLES WOODWARD PROTECTED OR THOUGHT HE PROTECTED THE VOLUMES WHICH GOOD NATURE MAY HAVE PROMPTED HIM TO LEND. HIS PLATE SHOWS AN OPENED VOLUME ON ONE PAGE OF WHICH IS WRITTEN NARRATIVEPROMISING TO SEND ME HOME AT THE APPOINTED TIME. FINIS. EVIDENTLY MR. WOODWARD LIKE THE HONEST LIAR BEFORE MENTIONED WAS NOT A MAN TO LEND HIS VOLUMES FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD.  HAVING QUOTED VARIOUS RECENT ENGLISH EXAMPLES OF THIS KIND WE ARE IN DUTY BOUND TO CITE SOME FROM OTHER COMPONENT PARTS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM.  UNDER THE NAME H. MACDONALD WE FIND      TEAR NOT NOR SOIL NOT      READ ALL BUT SPOIL NOT.        A GOOD BOOK IS A GOOD FRIEND HE WHO WOULD INJURE THE       ONE DESERVES NOT THE RESPECT OF THE OTHER.  THERE IS SOMETHING ALMOST PATHETIC IN THE EXCLAMATION WHICH MR. JOHN MARKS MAKES HIS VOLUMES UTTER GENTLE READER TAKE ME HOME I BELONG TO JOHN MARKS  COOK STREET CORK AND THEN THE EVILMINDED BORROWER IS REMINDED OF THE SCRIPTURAL CONDEMNATION OF HIS KIND BY REFERENCE TO PSALM XXXVII. VER. . BEFORE THIS COMES      ADVICE FOR THE MILLION      NEITHER A BORROWER OR A LENDER BE     FOR LOAN OFT LOSES BOTH ITSELF AND FRIEND     AND BORROWING DULLS THE EDGE OF HUSBANDRY.             TRUE FOR YOU MR. SHAKESPEARE      MORAL      OF ALL BOOKS AND CHATTELS THAT EVER I LENT     I NEVER GOT BACK FIVEANDTWENTY PER CENT.                       FAC MY BREDERN  WE MAY PRESUME FROM THIS THAT MR. JOHN MARKS TRIED TO BE FUNNY AND FROM HIS COMPOSITION GETTING INTO PRINT HE MAY FLATTER HIMSELF THAT HE SUCCEEDED.  ONE MORE EXAMPLE OF THESE WARNINGS TO BORROWERS AND WE HAVE DONE WITH THE SUBJECT. LORD DE TABLEY FIXES THE DATE OF IT AS  BUT SURELY IT MUST BE THE COMPOSITION OF SOME ELEVENTH CENTURY REPROBATE WHO ON HIS DEATHBED RICHLY ENDOWED A NEIGHBOURING MONASTERY AND THREATENED ANY ONE WHO SHOULD EVER DISTURB HIS ENDOWMENT. THE WORDS APPEAR ON THE BOOKPLATE OF O. MOORE AND THEY READ IN TRANSLATION IF ANY ONE STEALS THIS BOOK AND WITH FURTIVE HAND CARRIES IT OFF LET HIM GO TO THE FOUL WAVES OF ACHERON NEVER TO RETURN.  NOW LET US LOOK AT SOME OF THE EULOGIES OF BOOKS OR OF STUDY WHICH ARE FOUND ON BOOKPLATES. THESE DO NOT APPEAR UNTIL A MUCH LATER DATE. THE TEXT ON PIRCKHEIMERS BOOKPLATE THE FEAR OF THE LORD IS THE BEGINNING OF WISDOM CAN HARDLY BE CALLED ONE IN PRAISE OF STUDY THOUGH IT IS A WHOLESOME TRUTH THAT SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND BY EVERY STUDENT. INDEED WE HAVE TO PASS OVER MORE THAN TWO CENTURIES AFTER THE INVENTION OF BOOKPLATES BEFORE ONE WHICH IN THE INSCRIPTION UPON IT YIELDS AN EXAMPLE OF THE KIND NOW UNDER CONSIDERATION. THIS APPEARS AT LAST IN  IN A SENTIMENT EXPRESSED BY AN AUSTRIAN LAWYER JOHN SEYRINGER BY NAME. HERE IT IS      HE THAT WOULD LEARN WITHOUT THE AID OF BOOKS      DRAWS WATER IN A SIEVE FROM RUNNING BROOKS.  WE HAVE AGAIN TO PASS OVER MANY YEARS FOR OUR NEXT EXAMPLE. PETER DE MARIDAT WHO WAS HE TELLS US A SENATOR IN THE GREAT COUNCIL OF LOUIS XIV. OF FRANCE USED FOR A BOOKPLATE WHICH MAY THEREFORE BE DATED BEFORE  THE FIGURE OF A NEGRO WHO STANDS WITH ONE HAND RESTING ON A SHIELD OF ARMS AND HOLDS IN THE OTHER A PAIR OF SCALES. THE ARMS ON THE SHIELD ARE AZURE A CROSS ARGENT AND BELOW IS WRITTEN      INDE CRUCE HINC TRUTINA ARMATUS REGIQUE DEOQUE        MILITO DISCO MEIS HC DUO NEMPE LIBRIS  WHICH MAY BE CONSTRUED ARMED ON ONE SIDE WITH THE CROSS THE CROSS ON THE SHIELD AND ON THE OTHER WITH THE PAIR OF SCALES I FIGHT FOR MY KING AND FOR MY GOD. THESE TWO THINGS I INDEED LEARN FROM MY BOOKS LIBRIS BUT LIBRIS MAY ALSO BE TRANSLATED BALANCES AND HEREIN IS THE PUN  TAKING THEM CHRONOLOGICALLY OUR NEXT EXAMPLES ARE ON ENGLISH BOOKPLATES ONE IS DATED  AND THE OTHER EVIDENTLY BELONGS TO THE SAME PERIOD. ON THE FIRST THE REV. JOHN LLOYD WRITES ANIMUS SI QUUS QUOD PETIS HIC EST AND ON THE OTHER THOMAS ROBINSON A FELLOW OF MERTON QUOTES FROM CICERO DELECTANT DOMI NON IMPEDIUNT FORIS. PERHAPS HERBERT JACOB ESQ. OF ST. STEPHENS IN KENT HAD A GENERALLY TROUBLESOME WIFE WHO DID NOT PENETRATE THE SACRED REGION OF HIS LIBRARY HOWEVER IT MAY HAVE BEEN HE PLACED ON HIS BOOKPLATE CIRCA  OTIUM CUM LIBRIS A SENTIMENT EXPRESSED IN A GREAT VARIETY OF WAYS ON LATER BOOKPLATES.  SOME TEN YEARS LATER THAN THE LAST EXAMPLE IS THE BOOKPLATE OF A GERMAN CLERIC GOTTFRIED BALTHAZAR SCHARFF ARCHDEACON OF SCHWEIDNITZ A TOWN IN PRUSSIAN SILESIA ON WHICH HIS BOOKS ARE PRAISED IN SOME NOT UNGRACEFUL VERSES IN THESE THE OWNER ASKS DIVINE HELP IN UNDERSTANDING ARIGHT THE TEACHING OF HIS VOLUMES.  ON THE FLEMISH BOOKPLATE OF LEWIS BOSCH SPOKEN OF ELSEWHERE IN THIS VOLUME P.  WE READ BENEATH THE REPRESENTATION OF THE PRELATES LIBRARY IN WHICH HE IS SHOWN HARD AT WORK AMONG HIS BOOKS A HUNT IN SUCH A FOREST NEVER WEARIES. THE ALLUSION TO A FOREST OF BOOKS RECALLS THE MOTTO ON THE MUCH LATER ENGLISH BOOKPLATE OF MARY BERRY. ON THIS IS DEPICTED A WILD STRAWBERRY PLANT ITS FRUIT HALF HIDDEN BY LEAVES AND BELOW IS WRITTEN INTER FOLIA FRUCTUS. PROBABLY MISS BERRY BESIDES ALLUDING TO THE FRUIT OF KNOWLEDGE WHICH SHE FOUND AMONGST THE LEAVES OF HER BOOKS INTENDED A MILD PLAY UPON THE STRAWBERRY AND HER OWN FAMILY NAME.  BESIDES THESE A HOST OF FURTHER MOTTOES IN PRAISE OF BOOKS OR ABOUT BOOKS ARE TO BE MET WITH. SOME RECOMMEND THE COLLECTION OF AS LARGE A LIBRARY AS POSSIBLE OTHERS POINT OUT THAT THE MIND IS DISTRACTED BY A MULTITUDE OF BOOKS SOME ADVOCATE THE CAREFUL HANDLING OF A VOLUME EVEN AT THE EXPENSE OF NOT GETTING SO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH ITS CONTENTS WHILST OTHERS TELL US THAT WELLTHUMBED BOOKS ARE MONUMENTS OF THE OWNERS INDUSTRY AND CONSTANT STUDY. NOR ARE THE CONSOLING POWERS OF BOOKS FORGOTTEN. ON A VERY PRETTY RUSTIC VIGNETTE EXECUTED BY BONNER AFTER BEWICK W. B. CHORLEY OF LIVERPOOL HAS THE WORDS MY BOOKS THE SILENT FRIENDS OF JOY AND WOE.     CHAPTER X  PERSONAL PARTICULARS ON BOOKPLATES   HOW MUCH MORE COMMUNICATIVE IN THE MATTER OF PERSONAL PARTICULARS ARE SOME PEOPLE UPON THEIR BOOKPLATE THAN OTHERS WHAT A CONTRAST FOR INSTANCE BETWEEN THE INSCRIPTION ON WALPOLES BOOKPLATEMR. HORATIO WALPOLEAND THAT ON ONE OF PEPYSS ON WHICH HE STYLES HIMSELF ESQUIRE AND STATES THAT HE IS OF BRAMPTON IN HUNTINGTONSHIRE SECRETARY OF THE ADMIRALTY OF HIS MATY KING CHARLES THE SECOND AND DESCENDED OF YE ANCIENT FAMILY OF PEPYS OF COTTENHAM IN CAMBRIDGESHIRE.  OF COURSE SAM PEPYS WAS A VAIN MANTHAT WE ALL KNOW BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO INSCRIPTIONS HAS MORE TO DO WITH THE FASHION OF THE TIME THAN WITH THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TWO MEN. IN ENLARGING ON HIS PEDIGREE SOCIAL POSITION AND SECRETARYSHIP TO THE ADMIRALTY PEPYS WAS ONLY FOLLOWING THE CUSTOM OF HIS DAY. THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES OF SIMILAR INSCRIPTIONS ON BOOKPLATES CONTEMPORARY WITH PEPYSSCHARLES PITFEILD OF HOXTON IN THE PARISH OF ST. LEONARDS SHOREDITCH IN MIDDLESEX ESQR. DESCENDED OF THE ANCIENT FAMILY OF THE PITFEILDS OF SYMSBURY IN DORSETSHIRE AND IS NOW MARRIED TO WINIFRED ONE OF THE DAUGHTERS AND COEHEYRS OF JOHN ADDERLEY OF COTON IN STAFORDSHIRE ESQR. AND AGAINSR. HENRY HUNLOKE OF WINGERWORTH IN DERBYSHIRE BART. IN YE ESCOCHEON OF PRETENCE IS YE ARMES OF KATHERINE HIS LADY WHO WAS SOLE DAUGHTER AND HEYRE OF FRANCIS TYRWHIT OF KETTLEBY IN LINCOLNSHIRE ESQE YE LAST OF YE ELDEST BRANCH OF YT GREAT AND ANCIENT FAMILY. EQUALLY PROUD OF HIS ANCESTRY IS THOMAS WINDHAM OF SALE IN DEVONSHIRE ESQR. ONE OF THE GROOMS OF HIS MAJESTIES BEDCHAMBER THIRD SON OF SR EDMUND WINDHAM OF CATHANGER IN SOMERSETSHIRE KT. MARSHALL OF HIS MAJESTIES MOST HONBLE HOUSEHOLD WHO CONCLUDES THE INSCRIPTION ON HIS BOOKPLATE BY TELLING US THAT HE WAS LINEALLY DESCENDED FROM THE ANTIENT FAMILY OF THE WINDHAMS OF CROWNTHORPE IN THE COUNTY OF NORFOLK.  BUT THIS HABIT OF EXPRESSING PRIDE IN ANCESTRY THOUGH IT BECAME LESS FREQUENT CERTAINLY SURVIVED PEPYSS TIME. MR. J. PAUL RYLANDS F.S.A. HAS A COPY OF THE EIKON BASILIKE PRINTED IN  ON THE TITLEPAGE OF WHICH IS WRITTEN DAN. MERCATOR. WITHIN THE BOOK IS AN ARMORIAL BOOKPLATE ENGRAVED IN THE JACOBEAN STYLE AND SINCE IT BELONGED TO A MAN BORN IN  ONE OF THE EARLY EXAMPLES OF THAT STYLE. THE OWNER WAS THE EMINENT MATHEMATICIAN NICHOLAS MERCATOR WHO WAS BORN AT HOLSTEIN AND AFTERWARDS SETTLED IN ENGLAND WHERE HIS MATHEMATICAL ABILITY WAS RECOGNISED BY HIS ELECTION AS A FELLOW OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY. NICHOLAS WAS PROUD OF HIS ANCESTORS EFFORTS IN THE CAUSE OF PROTESTANTISM AND ALSO WISHED HIS ENGLISH FRIENDS TO BE AWARE OF THEM HE THEREFORE INSCRIBES HIS BOOKPLATE NICHOLAS MERCATOR A DESCENDANT OF THE KAUFFMANS OF PRAGUE IN BOHEMIA COADJUTORS WITH LUTHER IN THE REFORMATION.  ON THE CONTINENT LENGTHY EULOGIES OF ANCESTORS ARE COMMON AND THEY COMMENCE AT AN EARLY DATE. HERE IS ONE WHICH IS ALSO A SIGH FOR THE PURITY OF NOBILITY IN AGES PAST. IT IS UTTERED IN  BY JOHN GILES KNRINGEN WHO WRITES BELOW HIS SHIELD OF ARMS GIVEN IN COLOUR      THESE ARE THE FAMED INSIGNIA OF MY SIRES        WHICH IN THEIR PROPER COLOUR YOU MAY SEE      NOT BRIBES AS IS THE FASHION IN THESE DAYS        BUT VIRTUE RAISED THEM TO NOBILITY.  IT IS HOWEVER MOST FREQUENTLY IN AN ENUMERATION OF HIS OFFICES OR DEGREES THAT THE OWNER OF A BOOKPLATE ALLOWS HIMSELF TO GET WORDY. LET US TAKE FOR INSTANCE THE ALREADY MENTIONED BOOKPLATE OF SIR EDWARD DERING SEE PP.   WHICH BEARS DATE  AND DISPLAYS A SHIELD OF TWENTY COATS OF ARMS IT HAS A PROPORTIONATELY IMPRESSIVE DESCRIPTION OF SIR EDWARDS MANY OFFICESLIEUTENANT OF DOVER CASTLE VICECHANCELLOR AND VICEADMIRAL OF THE CINQUE PORTS ETC. SIR ROBERT SOUTHWELL KNIGHT TELLS US THAT HE IS ONE OF THE CLERKES ATTENDING HIS MAJESTY KING CHARLES THE SECOND IN HIS MOST HONOURABLE PRIVY COUNCELL ETC.  WILLIAM WHARTON WHO WAS KILLED IN A DUEL IN  CALLS HIMSELF FOURTH SON TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE PHILIP LORD WHARTON OF WHARTON IN WESTMORELAND BY ANN DAUGHTER TO WILLIAM CARR OF FERNIHAST IN SCOTLAND ESQR. ONE OF THE GROOME SIC OF THE BEDCHAMBER TO KING JAMES WHILST RANDOLPH EGERTON IN THE INSCRIPTION ON HIS BOOKPLATE RECALLS THE TIME WHEN THE UNHAPPY DUKE OF MONMOUTH WAS YET A TRUSTED OFFICER IN THE ROYAL ARMY RANDOLPH EGERTON OF BETLEY IN STAFORD SHIRE ESQUIRE LIEUTENANT OF HIS MAJESTYES OWN TROOP OF GUARD UNDER THE COMAND OF HIS GRACE JAMES DUKE OF MONMOUTH ETC.  THE BOOKPLATES OF THOMAS EARL OF WENTWORTH CONTAIN A CURIOUSLY LENGTHY ENUMERATION OF THE OFFICES ENJOYED BY THAT DISTINGUISHED SOLDIER AND DIPLOMATIST WHO AT A CRITICAL TIME STEERED HIS COUNTRY THROUGH A GREAT MANY DIFFICULTIES. THE FIRST IS DATED IN  AND ON IT THE OWNER DESCRIBES HIMSELF AS THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THOMAS WENTWORTH BARON OF RABY AND COLONELL OF HIS MAIESTIES OWNE ROYALL REGMT OF DRAGOONS . IN  WENTWORTH WAS SENT AS ENVOY TO BERLIN AND TWO YEARS LATER WAS ADVANCED TO THE POST OF AMBASSADOR. ON THIS APPOINTMENT HE HAD A SECOND BOOKPLATE ENGRAVED BEARING THE FOLLOWING INSCRIPTIONHIS EXCELLENCY THE RT HONBLE THO. WENTWORTH LORD RABY PEER OF ENGLAND COLLO OF HER MATYS ROYAL REGT OF DRAGOONS LIEUT GENERAL OF ALL HER MATYS FORCES  HER MATYS EMBASSADOR EXTRARY TO YE KING OF PRUSSIA SIZE   . ON THE FACE OF IT THIS IS FOREIGN WORK AND THE EXPRESSION PEER OF ENGLAND COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN PUT ON IT BY AN ENGLISH ENGRAVER.  WENTWORTHS LATER DIPLOMATIC POST HAS BEEN MADE FAMOUS BY SWIFTS ALLUSION TO IT IN REFERENCE TO HIS BEING ASSOCIATED WITH MAT PRIOR. WENTWORTH SAYS THE DEAN IS AS PROUD AS HELL AND HOW HE WILL BEAR ONE OF PRIORS MEAN BIRTH ON AN EQUAL CHARACTER WITH HIM I KNOW NOT. PROUD AS HELL WAS HE WELL HE CERTAINLY WAS PROUD OF HIS ADVANCE IN TITLE AND HIS MANY HIGH OFFICES ALL OF WHICH HE SETS OUT IN HIS THIRD AND LAST BOOKPLATE ALSO I THINK FOREIGN WORK DATED IN . HERE IS THE INSCRIPTION HIS EXCELLENCY THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THOMAS EARL OF STRAFFORD VISCOUNT WENTWORTH OF WENTWORTH WOODHOUSE AND OF STAINBOROUGH BARON OF RABY NEWMARCH AND OVERSLEY HER MAJESTYS AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY AND PLENIPOTENTIARY TO THE STATES GENERAL OF YE UNITED PROVINCES AND ALSO AT THE CONGRESS OF UTRECHT COLONEL OF HER MAJESTYS OWN ROYAL REGIMENT OF DRAGOONS LIEUTENANTGENERAL OF ALL HER FORCES FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTRY SIC OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND ONE OF THE LORDS OF HER MAJESTYS MOST HONOURABLE PRIVY COUNCIL AND KNIGHT OF THE MOST NOBLE ORDER OF YE GARTER. ON THE ACCESSION OF GEORGE I. AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO IMPEACH THIS BUSY LORD BUT IT FAILED AND HE RETIRED INTO PRIVATE LIFE FOR THE REST OF HIS DAYS. HIS MEMOIRS PUBLISHED A FEW YEARS BACK BY MR. CARTWRIGHT F.S.A. GIVE AN EXCELLENT PICTURE OF LIFE AT THE TIME HE LIVED.  SOME BOOKPLATE OWNERS NOT BOASTFUL OF THEIR TITLES LET US INTO THEIR CONFIDENCES AS TO THEIR PLACE OF BIRTH AGE AND THE LIKE. THE GERMAN BOOKPLATE DATED IN  OF JOHN VENNITZER A KNIFESMITH OR CUTLER BY TRADE TELLS US THAT HE WAS BORN AT NUREMBERG AT  MINUTES PAST  IN THE AFTERNOON ON THE TH DAY OF MAY . VENNITZER MADE MONEY BY HIS TRADE AND FOUNDED THE LIBRARY OF ST. LAWRENCE IN HIS NATIVE CITY PERHAPS THE DATE ON THE BOOKPLATE IS THAT OF THE FOUNDATION OF THE LIBRARY. NO DOUBT AS LORD DE TABLEY REMARKS THE CUTLER CONSCIENTIOUSLY BELIEVED THAT THE CONDITION OF HIS WHOLE LIFE DEPENDED ON THE PARTICULAR MOMENT AT WHICH HE ENTERED THE WORLD FOR HE WAS PROBABLY WELL VERSED IN THE MYSTERIES OF HOROSCOPY.  JOHN COLLET MAKES US REALLY QUITE FAMILIAR WITH ALL HIS RELATIONS AND WITH HIS OWN RELIGIOUS FEELINGS. HIS BOOKPLATEIT IS ONLY A PRINTED LABELREADS JOHANNES COLLET FILIUS THOM COLLET. PATER THOM GULIELMI AC JOHANNIS OMNIUM SUPERSTES. NATUS QUARTO JUNII . DENASCITURUS QUANDO DEO VISUM FUERIT INTERIM HUJUS PROPRIETARIUS JOHN SIC COLLET.

THE ABOVE MENTIONED THOMAS TERTIUS OKEY PROFESSOR OF PHYSICK NOW LIVETH IN LONDON NEAR THE BODYS OF HIS DECEASED RELATIONS. BEFORE SUCH DETAILS AS THESE EVEN JOHN COLLET SEEMS RETICENT.  SIR PHILIP SYDENHAMWHOSE PECULIARITIES IN THE MATTER OF BOOKPLATES ARE ELSEWHERE COMMENTED UPONIN ONE OF HIS FIRST EXAMPLES DATED IN  TELLS US HIS AGE SIR PHILIP SYDENHAM BART. OF BRYMPTON IN SOMERSET AND M.A. OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE TA. SU . RICHARD TOWNELEY IN  DOES THE SAME. THE INSCRIPTION ON HIS BOOKPLATE READS AS WE SEE BY THE FRONTISPIECE      EX LIBRIS BIBLIOTHEC DOMESTIC RICHARDI TOWNELEY DE      TOWNELEY IN AGRO LANCASTRENSI ARMIGERI ANNO TATIS                                                   DOMINI .  ONE CANNOT HELP WONDERING WHY MR. TOWNELEYTHE OWNER AND IN A GREAT PART THE COLLECTOR OF THE VAST LIBRARY WITH WHICH THE FAMILY NAME IS CONNECTEDSHOULD HAVE WAITED TILL HE WAS SEVENTYTHREE YEARS OF AGE TO HAVE A BOOKPLATE ENGRAVED. SOME OF THE VOLUMES IN THAT LIBRARY HAD A CURIOUS STAMP IN SILVER OF THE TOWNELEY ARMS WITH THE DATE  ON THEIR BINDINGS BUT THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE BEEN AN EARLIER BOOKPLATE. RICHARD TOWNELEY DIED AT YORK IN . BESIDES BEING AN ASTRONOMER AND A MATHEMATICIAN HE WAS A KEEN ANTIQUARY AND THORESBY THE HISTORIAN OF LEEDS TELLS US OF THE PRIDE WITH WHICH HE SHOWED HIM A WONDROUS AND JUST COMPLETED PEDIGREE OF THE TOWNELEY FAMILY ON THE OCCASION OF THEIR MEETING DURING THE YEAR IN WHICH THE BOOKPLATE WAS ENGRAVED.  JOHN FENWICK OF NEWCASTLEUPONTYNE ATTORNEY AT LAW LEAVES US IN IGNORANCE AS TO HIS AGE AT THE TIME HIS BOOKPLATE WAS ENGRAVED BECAUSE HE DOES NOT DATE IT BUT HE STATES THAT HE WAS BORN AT HEXHAM TH APRIL  AND MARRIED AT ALNWICK TH JUNE .  ONE LADYAND ONLY ONELETS US INTO WHAT WITH THOSE OF HER SEX IS USUALLY A SECRET. ISABEL DE MENEZES INSCRIBES HER BOOKPLATE BY BARTOLOZZI SEE P.  TATIS  ANNO .  I HAVE GIVEN IN THIS CHAPTER NO FOREIGN EXAMPLES OF BOOKPLATES ON WHICH MINUTE PERSONAL PARTICULARS APPEAR BUT SOME OF THE EXAMPLES OF WHICH I HAVE SPOKEN ELSEWHERENOTABLY THE FLEMISH BOOKPLATE OF COUNT VANDER NOOTWILL SHOW THAT THEY EXIST.     CHAPTER XI  LADIES BOOKPLATES   THERE SEEM TO BE REALLY SEVERAL GOOD AND LOGICAL REASONS WHY WE SHOULD SEPARATE FOR CONSIDERATION BY THEMSELVES THE BOOKPLATES WHICH HAVE BEEN USED BY LADIES. TO MENTION TWO THERE ARE CERTAIN DIFFERENCES SUCH AS THE SHAPE OF THE SHIELD IN WHICH THE ARMS ARE BORNE WHICH BY THE RIGID LAWS OF HERALDRY OUGHT TO APPEAR ON THESE BOOKPLATES WHEN BELONGING TO A MAID OR WIDOW MOREOVER LADIES BOOKPLATES THOUGH SOMETIMES MERE PRINTED LABELS ARE GENERALLY MORE FANCIFUL IN DESIGN THAN THE MAJORITY OF THOSE OWNED BY THE STERNER SEX.  THE WHOLE SUBJECT OF LADIES BOOKPLATES HAS BEEN SO EXHAUSTIVELY TREATED BY MISS NORNA LABOUCHERE THAT IT NEED NOT TAKE UP MUCH SPACE IN THE PRESENT CHAPTER. WHEN HOWEVER IN THIS WORK MISS LABOUCHERE ASKS WHERE ARE BOOKPLATES OF THE ENGLISH FEMININE BIBLIOPHILES OF THE FIFTEENTH SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURIESDAME JULIANA BERNERS MARGARET ROPER LADY JANE GREY MARY STUART AND THE LADIES OF LITTLE GIDDINGTHE ANSWER I AM AFRAID IS THEY HAD NONE. HAD THEY POSSESSED THEM THEY WOULD IN THIS BOOKPLATESPYING AGE HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED.  ILLUSTRATION LADY BATHS BOOKPLATE.  BUT BE IT SAID TO THE CREDIT OF THE LADIES SOME OF THE EARLIEST DATED ENGLISH BOOKPLATES BELONGED TO THEM. IT IS TRUE THESE ARE MERELY NAMETICKETS SUCH AS THAT OF ELIZABETH PINDAR  IN THE BAGFORD COLLECTION KINDLY POINTED OUT TO ME BY MR. W. Y. FLETCHER BUT THE FACT OF THEIR EXISTENCE DESERVES NOTICE BECAUSE IT SHOWS THE READINESS OF THE FAIR SEX TO LAY HOLD OF A NEW FASHION AND HAVING A BOOKPLATE IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY WAS A NEW FASHION AT LEAST IN ENGLAND.  THE FIRST ARMORIAL LADIES BOOKPLATE IS THAT OF THE COUNTESSDOWAGER OF BATH ALREADY VERY FULLY DESCRIBED. I WILL ONLY ADD THAT READERS WHO REFER BACK TO WHAT I HAVE SAID ABOUT HER MATRIMONIAL ARRANGEMENTS VIDE P.  WILL SEE THAT SHE IS HERALDICALLY ACCURATE IN NOT BEARING HER ARMS IN A LOZENGE. THE LAWS OF HERALDRY DO NOT ALLOW LADIES WHILE MARRIED TO PLACE THEIR ARMS IN LOZENGESHAPED SHIELDS AND THIS FACT ENABLES SOME FEMININE BOOKPLATE OWNERS TO DEMONSTRATE THE POSSESSION OF A VIRTUE WHICH WOMEN ARE OFTEN TAXED WITH LACKINGECONOMY. LADIES FREQUENTLY MADE THE SAME DESIGNS DO DUTY AS THEIR OWN BOOKPLATES WHICH HAD SERVED FOR THEIR HUSBANDS. BUT ACCORDING TO MISS LABOUCHERE THE HUSBAND SOMETIMES USED HIS WIFES BOOKPLATE FOR THE BOOKPLATESIDENTICAL SAVE FOR THE INSCRIPTIONSOF THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OF BEAUFORT LORD AND LADY ROOS AND SOME OTHERS SHOW ON EXAMINATION THAT THE WORDS INDICATIVE OF OWNERSHIP BY THE LADY HAVE BEEN ERASED AND OVERENGRAVED BY THOSE INDICATIVE OF POSSESSION BY HER LORD.  THE LOZENGE REALLY LOOKS VERY WELL ON A BOOKPLATE AND LENDS ITSELF READILY TO THE DECORATION USUALLY BESTOWED UPON IT. TAKE FOR INSTANCE THAT OF DAME ANNE MARGARETTA MASON DATED IN . HER MAIDEN NAME WAS LONG AND THE SHIELD SHOWS US MASON IMPALING LONG. LADY MASONS IS A FAIR SAMPLE OF A LADYS BOOKPLATE OF THAT DATE. THE ARMS ARE CONTAINED IN A LOZENGE SET IN A JACOBEAN FRAME WHICH IS LINED WITH SCALE WORK AND ADORNED WITH RIBBONS AND LEAFY SPRAYS. THERE IS NO MOTTOSCROLL BUT THE NAME BRACKET COMES UP CLOSE TO THE BASE OF THE DESIGN SEE ALSO P. .  INDEED IT MAY BE SAID THAT THE JACOBEAN STYLE OF ORNAMENTATION IS THAT BEST SUITED TO LADIES BOOKPLATES ESPECIALLY WHEN THE ARMS ARE DEPICTED ON A LOZENGESHAPED SHIELD. THE BOOKPLATE OF THE HON. ANNE NORTH BY SIMON GRIBELIN IS ANOTHER INSTANCE TO PROVE THIS. I DO NOT THINK THAT CHIPPENDALE DECORATION SUITS THEM AT ALL AND IN THE USE OF ORNAMENTS OF THAT STYLE ENGLISHWOMEN WERE AS IMMODERATE AS ENGLISHMEN. LADY LOMBES BOOKPLATE DESIGNED IN THE LATER DAYS OF CHIPPENDALISM IS QUITE APPALLING FROM ITS OVERORNAMENTATION. THE WREATH OF RIBBON OR FESTOON STYLE OF THE CLOSE OF THE LAST CENTURY IS MORE SUITABLE FOR LADIES BOOKPLATES AND SOME VERY CHARMING EXAMPLES ARE KNOWN EQUALLY SUITABLE IT SEEMS TO ME WOULD HAVE BEEN THE PICTURE OR LANDSCAPE STYLETHE STYLE IN WHICH AT THE CLOSE OF THE LAST CENTURY BEWICK AND SOME FEW OTHER ENGLISH ARTISTS WERE WORKING WITH CONSPICUOUS SUCCESS AND IT SEEMS STRANGE THAT THE LADIES OF GREAT BRITAIN DID NOT ADOPT IT MORE EXTENSIVELY.  WHEN WE COME TO MODERN TIMES WE FIND LADIES HAVE RUN AS WILD AS THEIR LORDS OVER BOOKPLATES THERE IS THE SAME PECULIARITY THE SAME MYSTICISM THE SAME INAPPROPRIATENESS FOR BOOKPLATES IN THE DESIGNS OF MANY BOOKPLATES OF FIN DE SICLE ENGLISH LADIES. THE FEW REALLY ARTISTIC AND APPROPRIATE BOOKPLATES STAND OUT IN MARKED CONTRAST IN MISS LABOUCHERES EXCELLENT LITTLE BOOK AND AMONGST THEM MAY BE NOTED LADY MAYOS DESIGNED IN  BY MR. ANNING BELL WHICH SHOWS US A MUSICIAN AND A SONGSTRESS WITHIN A FRAME COMPOSED OF SPRING FLOWERS AND THE NATIONAL EMBLEM OF IRELAND.  BUT LET US GO BACK A LITTLE IN DATE AND LOOK AT A LADIES BOOKPLATE DESIGNED IN THE ALLEGORIC STYLE WHAT MORE STRIKING EXAMPLE COULD BE FOUND THAN THAT FURNISHED BY GEORGE VERTUES CHARMING PIECE OF WORK ENGRAVED FOR LADY OXFORD  ILLUSTRATION  IT REPRESENTS THE INTERIOR OF THE LIBRARY EITHER AT BRAMPTON OR WELBECK PROBABLY THE LATTER WHICH WAS LADY OXFORDS OWN INHERITANCE. THROUGH A DOORWAY FLANKED BY CORINTHIAN COLUMNS THE CURTAIN IN FRONT OF WHICH IS DRAWN BACK WE OBTAIN A VIEW OF A COUNTRY HOUSE STANDING BACK IN A WELLKEPT PARK A RIVER CROSSED BY A THREEARCHED BRIDGE MEANDERS THROUGH THIS. BUT IT IS THE OCCUPANTS OF THE ROOM THAT CALL FOR MOST ATTENTION. THE PROMINENT FIGURE IS THAT OF MINERVA WHO HAS LAID ASIDE HER ARMS AND STANDS SANDALLED AND HELMETED. SHE IS BUSILY ENGAGED IN INSTRUCTING SIX CUPIDS WHO APPEAR TO BE INDUSTRIOUSLY FOLLOWING HER INJUNCTIONS. ONE OF THESE IS PAINTING IN OILS WITH AN EASEL BEFORE HIM AND A PALETTE ON HIS THUMB THE GODDESS WITH HER LEFT HAND POINTS OUT SOME DEFECT IN HIS WORK AND APPARENTLY EXPLAINS HOW IT MAY BE REMEDIED. ANOTHER CUPID PLAYS THE HARP TWO MORE SIT ON THE FRAME OF THE DESIGN WEAVING FLOWING FESTOONS ANOTHER ALSO ON THE FRAME NEAR A CELESTIAL GLOBE COPIES THE PICTURE OF A FLUTEPLAYING SATYR WHICH A SIXTH CUPID HOLDS IN POSITION.  ON THE FRAME WHICH SURROUNDS THE PICTURE SIT TWO FIGURESONE OF WHICH IS MERCURY WITH CADUCEUS AND WINGED HATWHO ACT AS SUPPORTERS TO A MEDALLION BEARING LADY OXFORDS MONOGRAM ABOVE IS AN URN AND FROM THE SIDES FALL BUNCHES OF GRAPES. BELOW THE DESIGN IS ENGRAVED HENRIETTA CAVENDISH HOLLES OXFORD AND MORTIMER. GIVEN ME BYAND THEN THE DONORS NAME AND LAST TWO FIGURES OF THE DATE FILLED IN BY LADY OXFORD HERSELF.  LADY OXFORD WAS THE SOLE HEIRESS OF JOHN HOLLES LAST DUKE OF NEWCASTLE OF THE HOLLES FAMILY AND WAS THE WIFE OF EDWARD SECOND EARL OF OXFORD SON OF QUEEN ANNES MINISTER AND THE CONTINUATOR AND COMPLETOR OF THE HARLEIAN COLLECTIONS. VERTUES LOVE OF STUDYING ALL KINDS OF ANTIQUITIES BROUGHT HIM AT AN EARLY DATE INTO CONTACT WITH LORD OXFORD WHO PROVED ONE OF HIS WARMEST PATRONS. THE ARTIST HIMSELF SPEAKS OF THE EARLS GENEROUS AND UNPARALLELED ENCOURAGEMENT OF MY UNDERTAKINGS. HARLEY WOULD TAKE HIS FRIEND WITH HIM ON HIS VARIOUS HUNTING TOURS IN ENGLAND GETTING HIM TO SKETCH THE NUMEROUS OBJECTS OF INTEREST THAT THEY CAME ACROSS. NO WONDER THAT THE EARLS DEATH IN  WAS A HEAVY LOSS IN EVERY WAY TO GEORGE VERTUE.  IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT THERE IS NO TRACE OF HERALDRY IN THIS REMARKABLE BOOKPLATE. BOOKPLATES FREE FROM ANYTHING ARMORIAL WERE NOT THE RULE IN ENGLAND IN  AND VERTUE WAS CERTAINLY PROFICIENT IN HERALDIC ENGRAVING OR OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN SO SINCE HIS EARLIEST TASK IN LIFE WAS ENGRAVING COATS OF ARMS ON PLATE AND HIS SECOND ENGAGEMENT WAS WITH MICHAEL VANDERGUCHT WHO WE KNOW EXECUTED A GOOD DEAL OF ARMORIAL WORK. IT IS PROBABLE THEREFORE THAT THE IDEA OF THE BOOKPLATE WAS LADY OXFORDS OWN.  FROM THIS DELIGHTFUL SPECIMEN OF A LADYS BOOKPLATE IN WHICH HERALDRY IS ENTIRELY ABSENT WE MAY APPROPRIATELY TURN OUR ATTENTION TO TWO EXAMPLES WHICH COMBINE HERALDRY WITH A FANCIFUL DESIGNTHE BOOKPLATES OF LADY POMFRET AND THE HONOURABLE MRS. DAMER. THE FIRST OF THESE IS THAT WHICH S. W. PROBABLY SAMUEL WALE THE ROYAL ACADEMICIAN ENGRAVED FOR THE RT HONBLE HENRIETTA LOUISA JEFFREYS COUNTESS OF POMFRET LADY OF THE BEDCHAMBER TO QUEEN CAROLINE AND IS A VERY UNUSUAL PIECE OF WORK BOTH IN SHAPE DESIGN AND HERALDRY. THERE IS A CLEAR INDICATION OF CHIPPENDALEISM ABOUT THE SHIELD AND SPRAYS OF FLOWERS AND LEAVES WHICH IS CERTAINLY CURIOUS IN VIEW OF WHAT WE MUST CONSIDER THE APPROXIMATE DATE OF THE BOOKPLATE BUT THE ARMS ARE IN A JACOBEAN FRAME WHICH STANDS IN A GARDEN. ON ONE SIDE WE HAVE A CUPID BEARING ALOFT THE LADYS FAMILY CREST AND ON THE OTHER THE HUSBANDS CREST AND HELMET SITUATED JUST WITHIN THE OPENING OF A TENT. LADY POMFRET WAS THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF JAMES II.S INFAMOUS LORD CHANCELLOR. SHE MARRIED LORD POMFRET IN  AND WAS LADY OF THE BEDCHAMBER TO QUEEN CAROLINE FROM  TO  SO THAT WE ARE ENABLED TO FIX THE DATE OF THIS PLATE WITHIN SEVENTEEN YEARS INDEED PROBABLY WITHIN FOUR YEARS FOR SHE HAD A LESS AMBITIOUS AND NO DOUBT EARLIER BOOKPLATE ENGRAVED FOR HER WHICH BEARS THE DATE .  AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED THE BOOKPLATE OF SELINA COUNTESS OF HUNTINGDON FORMS A STRIKING CONTRAST TO THAT LAST DESCRIBED. HERE WE HAVE A PLAIN REPRESENTATION OF A COAT OF ARMS IN A LOZENGE AND SUPPORTED IN THE ORTHODOX MANNER. NO CUPIDS OR OTHER VANITIES INTRUDE THEMSELVES INTO THIS SOMBRE AND COARSELY EXECUTED WORK WHICH MAY BE DATED AFTER THE OWNER BECAME A WIDOW IN  AND THEREFORE AFTER HER CALLWHICH IS I BELIEVE THE CORRECT EXPRESSION FOR A SUDDEN CONVERSION TO THE FORM OF RELIGION SHE EMBRACED.  PROBABLY OF ABOUT THE SAME DATE AS LADY HUNTINGDONS BOOKPLATE IS THAT OF ANOTHER FAMOUS WOMAN OF HER DAY LADY BETTY GERMAIN ABOUT WHOM SWIFT HAS PLENTY TO SAY IN HIS JOURNAL TO STELLA. ON THIS BOOKPLATE A SOMEWHAT FUNEREAL EFFECT IS PRODUCED BY THE DARK BACKGROUND AGAINST WHICH IS THE LOZENGE CONTAINING THE ARMS BERKELEY IMPALING GERMAIN BUT THE ORNAMENTATION OF THE LOZENGE OF THE NAMESCROLL AND OF THE FRAME ENCLOSING THE DESIGN IS LIGHT AND ELEGANT. POOR LADY BETTY SHE HAD A GOOD DEAL TO LIVE DOWN HER GIRLHOOD HAD NOT BEEN SO MORAL AS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AND THE DUCHESS OF MARLBOROUGH DID HER BEST TO MAKE HER FRIENDS MISFORTUNES AS PUBLIC AS POSSIBLE. BUT FOR ALL THAT ELIZABETH BERKELEY MADE A GOOD MATCH IN POINT OF MONEY MARRYINGAS HIS SECOND WIFESIR JOHN GERMAIN A SOLDIER OF FORTUNE AND REPUTE. HE LEFT HER A WIDOW IN  WITH DRAYTON AS HER HOME AND A VAST FORTUNE. HER WIDOWHOOD LASTED VERY NEARLY FIFTY YEARS DURING WHICH SHE GAVE AWAY LARGE SUMS IN CHARITY AS WELL AS SPENDING THEM ON AMASSING CURIOS THESE IN  WALPOLE WENT TO LOOK AT AND ADMIRED.  BUT WE HAVE BEEN DIGRESSING AND HAVE NOT YET SPOKEN ABOUT THE SECOND OF THE TWO BOOKPLATES JUST NOW MENTIONED THAT OF THE HON. MRS. DAMER WHICH IN DESIGN AND EXECUTION CERTAINLY SURPASSES ANY LADIES BOOKPLATE YET NOTICED IT IS REALLY A BEAUTIFUL PICTURE. FIRST LET ME SPEAK OF MRS. DAMER AND HER SURROUNDINGS HER BOOKPLATE BECOMES THE MORE INTERESTING AS WE CALL THESE TO MIND. THE DAUGHTER OF FIELDMARSHAL HENRY SEYMOUR CONWAY SHE MADE FOR HERSELF AT AN EARLY AGE A NAME BOTH IN ENGLAND AND ITALY AS AN ACCOMPLISHED SCULPTRESS. FROM INFANCYSHE WAS BORN IN SHE WAS THE PET OF HORACE WALPOLE AND THROUGHOUT HER LIFE HIS INTIMATE FRIEND LIVING AFTER HER HUSBANDS SUICIDE CLOSE TO HIM AT STRAWBERRY HILL WHICH HE BEQUEATHED TO HER BY HIS WILL AND WHERE BY THE WAY THE WORK OF HER ARTISTIC FINGERS MIGHT BE SEEN IN PROFUSION. FRIENDS OF HERSELF AND OF WALPOLE WERE ROBERT BERRY AND HIS DAUGHTERS MARY AND AGNESMY TWIN WIVES WALPOLE CALLS THEM. MRS. DAMERS BOOKPLATE IS THE WORK OF THE LATTER OF THESE TWO LADIESWALPOLES SWEET LAMB AGNES. IT SHOWS US A KNEELING FEMALE FIGURE POINTING TO A NEWLYCUT INSCRIPTION ON A BLOCK OF STONE ANNA DAMER ABOVE IS A SHIELD BEARING THE ARMS OF DAMER WITH THOSE OF SEYMOURCONWAY ON AN ESCUTCHEON OF PRETENCE AND ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT OF THIS ARE ELEGANTLY DRAWN DOGS. THE WORK WAS ENGRAVED BY FRANCIS LEGAT AND IS DATED . MISS MARY BERRYS BOOKPLATE HAS BEEN ALREADY SPOKEN OF P. .  AS AN ILLUSTRATION TO THIS CHAPTER ON LADIES BOOKPLATES I HAVE TAKEN ONE WHICH IS BOTH ARTISTIC AND INTERESTING FROM THE FACT THAT IT SHOWS USIN THE FIGURE CONTEMPLATING THE BUSTWHAT IS PRESUMABLY A PICTURE OF THE OWNER. I FEAR HOWEVER THAT PROOF OF ITS AUTHENTICITY AS A LIKENESS SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW OF ITS INCORPORATION AS A PORTRAIT BOOKPLATE SEE PP.  WILL NOT BE FORTHCOMING BUT WHETHER IT IS ONE OR NOT IT IS CERTAINLY A PLEASING BOOKPLATE. FRANCES ANNE ACLAND THE OWNER WAS BORN IN  BECAME THE WIFE OF RICHARD HOARE OF BARNE ELMS IN  AND THUS STEPMOTHER TO RICHARD COLT HOARE THE FUTURE ANTIQUARY AND THE HISTORIAN OF WILTSHIRE SHE DIED IN THE YEAR  AND WAS BURIED AT BECKENHAM.  ILLUSTRATION  BUT ALL THAT HAS BEEN SAID SO FAR CONCERNS THE BOOKPLATES OF ENGLISH WOMEN. FOREIGN DAMES OF VARIOUS NATIONALITIES AND OUR FEMININE COUSINS ACROSS THE ATLANTIC SEE P.  HAVE MADE A VERY GENEROUS USE OF THESE MARKS OF BOOKPOSSESSION. FRENCH WOMEN OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY HAVE AS THE READER OF MISS LABOUCHERES INTERESTING PAGES ON THIS PART OF HER SUBJECT WILL SEE FOR THE MOST PART USED BOOKSTAMPS MANY OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FRENCH BINDINGS GAINING AN ADDITIONAL INTEREST AND BEAUTY FROM THE COATS OF ARMS OF THEIR FAIR OWNERS IMPRESSED UPON THEM. THERE ARE HOWEVER A FAIRLY LARGE NUMBER OF BOOKPLATES KNOWN WHICH HAVE BELONGED TO FRENCH WOMEN OR AT ALL EVENTS TO WOMEN RESIDENT IN FRANCE AND AMONGST THEM ONE TO WHICH ATTACHES PATHETIC INTEREST FROM THE TRAGIC FATE OF ITS OWNER. I MEAN THAT OF THE PRINCESSE DE LAMBALLE WHO FELL A VICTIM TO HER ATTACHMENT TO THE REIGNING HOUSE OF FRANCE DURING THE REVOLTING MASSACRES OF .  THERE ARE SUCH THINGS AS JOINT BOOKPLATESBOOKPLATES WHICH HAVE BELONGED BOTH TO HUSBANDS AND WIVES. WE MEET WITH SOME SUCH IN ENGLAND THOUGH NOT AT A VERY EARLY DATE BUT IN GERMANY THEY EXIST AS FAR BACK AS . IN ENGLAND THE FIRST EXAMPLE ONLY A PRINTED LABEL IS IN MR. THOMAS AND MRS. ANNE PAIN. EXAMPLES OF THIS DUAL OWNERSHIP OCCUR FREQUENTLY IN MODERN BOOKPLATES.  FOR OTHER POINTS OF INTEREST IN AND ABOUT LADIES BOOKPLATES THE READER MUST CONSULT MISS LABOUCHERES WORK ALL I WILL DO IN CONCLUDING MY REMARKS UPON THEM IS TO SAY THATAS MIGHT PERHAPS BE EXPECTEDIN PHRASES OF BOOKPOSSESSION LADIES ARE EVEN MORE OUTSPOKEN THAN GENTLEMEN FEW HOWEVER ARE SO MUCH SO AS LADY DOROTHY NEVILL WHO PROTECTS HER BOOKS WITH THE WORDS STOLEN FROM PLACED BEFORE HER NAME SURELY SHE CAN BE NO MORE TROUBLED BY BORROWERS THAN WAS THE CAVALIER MACCIUCCA VIDE P. .  FOOTNOTES   SHE MARRIED IN  THE HON. JOHN DAMER A SON OF LORD MILTON.   A VARIETY OF THIS BOOKPLATE EXISTS ON WHICH THE INSCRIPTION READS ANNA SEYMOURDAMER.     CHAPTER XII  THE MORE PROMINENT ENGRAVERS OF ENGLISH BOOKPLATES   WILLIAM MARSHALL HEADS OUR LIST OF ENGRAVERS OF ENGLISH BOOKPLATES. WE KNOW OF BUT ONE SPECIMEN OF HIS WORK BUT IT IS EXCEEDINGLY FINETHE ANONYMOUS PLATE OF THE LYTTELTON FAMILY DESCRIBED ON P. . MARSHALLS WORKS ARE DATED BETWEEN  AND . NEXT AFTER HIM COMES THE WELLKNOWN ENGRAVER OF PORTRAITS WILLIAM FAITHORNE B.  D.  WHOSE PORTRAIT BOOKPLATE OF BISHOP HACKET IS FIGURED OPPOSITE. DAVID LOGGAN THE ENGRAVER OF THE ISHAM BOOKPLATES IN  IS THE ARTIST NEXT ON OUR ROLL. HOW MANY BOOKPLATES HE DESIGNED AND ENGRAVED I DO NOT KNOW BUT THERE ARE TWO OR THREE EARLY ENGLISH EXAMPLES WHICH IN THEIR ARRANGEMENT AND TOUCH RESEMBLE SOMEWHAT CLOSELY HIS WORK FOR ISHAM.  ILLUSTRATION  ABOUT THIS SAME DATE MICHAEL BURGHERS WAS ENGRAVING BOOKPLATES IN ENGLAND HE APPEARS TO HAVE LEFT HOLLAND IN  AND TO HAVE SETTLED IN OXFORD. THE EARLIEST BOOKPLATE OF HIS THAT I HAVE SEEN IS THAT OF THOMAS GORE ALREADY DESCRIBED PERHAPS HE FOUND THE ALLEGORY WITH WHICH HE EMBELLISHED IT WAS NOT POPULAR WITH ENGLISHMEN AND HIS OTHER BOOKPLATESWE KNOW OF TWO OR THREEARE IN THE SIMPLE ARMORIAL STYLE USUAL IN ENGLISH BOOKPLATES OF THE PERIOD. LORD DE TABLEY SUGGESTS THAT CHRISTOPHER SARTORIUS WHO WORKED AT NUREMBERG BETWEEN  AND  MAY BE CONNECTED WITH THE JAMES SARTOR WHO SIGNED A FINE ENGLISH JACOBEAN BOOKPLATE AT THE OPENING OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY OF THIS JAMES WE KNOW NOTHING EXCEPT THIS PIECE OF WORK WHICH IS CERTAINLY GOOD. AFTER SARTOR COMES JOHN PINE WHOSE POMPOUS BOOKPLATE ENGRAVED ABOUT THE YEAR  TO COMMEMORATE GEORGE I.S GIFT OF BOOKS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AND FIGURED P. . HE WAS BORN IN  AND DIED IN . HIS ENGRAVINGS OF THE TAPESTRY IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS BECAME SO POPULAR THAT HE WAS THE SUBJECT OF A SPECIAL ACT OF PARLIAMENT SECURING TO HIM THE EMOLUMENTS ARISING FROM THE SALE OF THE WORK. PINE AS WE HAVE SEEN ENGRAVED OTHER BOOKPLATES LATER ON IN THE CENTURY.  MICHAEL VANDERGUCHT THE FAMOUS ANTWERP ENGRAVER WAS ALSO WORKING IN ENGLAND BEFORE THE CLOSE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY BUT HIS FIRST BOOKPLATE IS DATED IN . THIS WAS ENGRAVED FOR SIR WILLIAM FLEMING OF RYDAL AND IS IN MANY RESPECTS A STRIKING PIECE OF WORK. THE STYLE IS QUITE ENGLISH OF THE PERIOD HEAVY MANTLING DESCENDS TO THE BASE OF THE SHIELD BUT THE INSCRIPTIONTHE PATERNAL ARMS OF SIR WILLIAM FLEMING OF RYDAL IN THE COUNTY OF WESTMORELAND BARONET WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THE HERALDRYSAVOURS MUCH OF BEING THE WORK OF A FOREIGNER. IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED OF THIS ARTIST THAT HE WAS PUPIL OF ONE OF THE MANY BOUTATS WHO WERE ACTIVE AS ENGRAVERS OF FOREIGN BOOKPLATES. HE VANDERGUCHT DIED IN BLOOMSBURY IN .  AFTER HIM WE MAY APPROPRIATELY MENTION HIS PRINCIPAL PUPILGEORGE VERTUE. HIS MOST CONSPICUOUS BOOKPLATE IS CERTAINLY THAT OF LADY OXFORD WHICH IS ALREADY FAMILIAR TO THE READER.  SIMON GRIBELIN IS WELL KNOWN AS A BOOKILLUSTRATOR AND FINDS FREQUENT MENTION BY WALPOLE. HE WAS BORN AT BLOIS IN  CAME TO ENGLAND WHEN NINETEEN AND WORKED HERE TILL HIS DEATH IN . PERHAPS THE EARLIEST BOOKPLATE HE ENGRAVED IS THAT OF SIR PHILIP SYDENHAM WHICH SHOWS US THE SHIELD AND CREST ENCIRCLED WITH SNAKES AND OTHER ORNAMENTSA BOOKPLATE DECIDEDLY FOREIGN IN APPEARANCE THOUGH GRIBELIN MUST HAVE BEEN NEARLY TWENTY YEARS IN ENGLAND WHEN IT WAS ENGRAVED. HE DID TWO OTHER BOOKPLATES FOR SIR PHILIP. HE ALSO ENGRAVED SOME OF THE PAROCHIAL LIBRARY PLATES DESCRIBED LATER ON PP.  AND SOME OTHERS.  ILLUSTRATION  THOUGH J. SKINNER SEE PP.  AN ENGRAVER WHO WORKED AT BATH DOES NOT FIND MENTION IN ANY DICTIONARY OF ENGRAVERS YET HE DESERVES NOTICE FROM THE STUDENT OF BOOKPLATES FOR THE GREAT QUANTITY OF HIS WORK IN THAT FIELDNEARLY ALL DATED AND SOME REALLY VERY EXCELLENT. OF SKINNER LORD DE TABLEY WRITESI WOULD GLADLY LEARN SOME BIOGRAPHICAL DETAILS BUT HE FAILED TO FIND ANY AND I HAVE BEEN EQUALLY UNFORTUNATE. AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM THERE IS NO BATH NEWSPAPER OR DIRECTORY SUFFICIENTLY EARLY TO CONTAIN EITHER AN ADVERTISEMENT BY SKINNER OR A MENTION OF HIS PLACE OF RESIDENCE IN THE BATH DIRECTORY OF  THE NAME IS REPRESENTED BY TWO GROCERS A PUBLICAN A GARDENER AND ONE PRIVATE RESIDENTA MISS SKINNER WHO LIVED AT  ST. JAMESS PARADE. SIR WOLLASTON FRANKS TELLS ME THAT AMONGST THE ENGRAVERS WHO VOUCHED FOR THE PERFECTION OF SYMPSONS NEW BOOK OF CYPHERTHE MOST PERFECT AND NEATEST DRAWN OF ANY PERFORMANCE OF THE KIND HITHERTO EXTANTWAS ONE JACOB SKINNER AND IT IS VERY LIKELY THIS WAS OUR FRIEND THE ENGRAVER OF BOOKPLATES WHO LABOURED AT BATH FROM  TO . HE WORKED IN THREE SUCCESSIVE STYLES OF ENGLISH BOOKPLATE ENGRAVINGTHE ARMORIAL THE JACOBEAN AND THE CHIPPENDALE A FACT WHICH RENDERS HIS PLATES OF SPECIAL INTEREST TO COLLECTORS SINCE IT ENABLES THEM TO SEE HOW THE SAME HAND TREATS THE SUCCEEDING STYLES WHEN FULLY DEVELOPED AND DURING THEIR GRADUAL CHANGE FROM ONE STYLE INTO THE OTHER. HIS EARLIEST DATED BOOKPLATE THAT WE KNOW IS THAT FOR THE LIBRARY OF SIR CHRISTOPHER MUSGRAVE FIGURED OPPOSITE AND THE NEXT FIVE YEARS LATER THAT OF JOHN CONYERS OF WALTHAMSTOW IN ESSEX ESQ. HERE THE ORNAMENTATION IS QUITE JACOBEAN THE SHIELD IS OVAL WITH WINGLIKE EXCRESCENCES AT THE TOP AND ON EITHER SIDETHAT AT THE TOP FORMING A BACKGROUND TO THE HELMET WHICH SUPPORTS THE CREST. NEXT YEAR  SKINNER PRODUCED THE BOOKPLATE OF FRANCIS CARINGTON ESQ. OF WOTTON WARWICKSHIREIN APPEARANCE EVEN EARLIER THAN THAT OF MUSGRAVE. SOME OF THIS EARLY APPEARANCE IS PERHAPS DUE TO AN ABSENCE OF INDICATION OF THE TINCTURES ON THE SHIELDA HABIT WHICH AS WE SHALL PRESENTLY SEE SKINNER FOLLOWED IN ONE OR TWO OTHER INSTANCES. A SLIGHT MANTLING FALLS FROM AN ESQUIRES HELMET AND DESCENDS A LITTLE WAY DOWN THE SHIELD TILL IT JOINS THE JACOBEAN SCROLLWORK AND THE OWNERS NAME AND DESCRIPTION ARE UPON A FRINGED CLOTH. BUT THE FEATURE TO NOTE IN THIS BOOKPLATE IS THE MONOGRAMMATIC FORM OF THE ENGRAVERS SIGNATURE ILLUSTRATION JS SYMBOL. IT IS THE FIRST TIME HE USES IT AND IN HIS SUBSEQUENT DATED WORK HE APPEARS ALWAYS TO HAVE ADOPTED SOME SIMILAR FORM THIS BEING THE MOST FREQUENTILLUSTRATION JS SYMBOLKINR.  ILLUSTRATION  I HAVE SPOKEN OF J. SKINNER AS A BATH ENGRAVER BUT THE READER WILL OBSERVE THAT NONE OF THE BOOKOWNERS WHOSE BOOKPLATES BY HIM I HAVE AS YET NAMED ARE SPECIALLY CONNECTED WITH BATH AND ON NONE HAS THE ENGRAVER MENTIONED IT AS HIS PLACE OF RESIDENCE BUT INSOMUCH AS THENIN THE PALMY DAYS OF THE REIGN OF KING NASHALL ROADS LED TO BATH IT IS PROBABLE THAT AT THE FASHIONABLE SEASON THE CUMBERLAND BARONET AS WELL AS THE ESSEX AND WARWICKSHIRE SQUIRES FOUND HIS WAY THITHER AND FOLLOWED THE FASHION BY HAVING A BOOKPLATE ENGRAVED JUST AS HE WOULD FOLLOW IT DURING HIS SOJOURN IN THE ANCIENT CITY BY SQUANDERING HIS TIME AND INJURING HIS DIGESTION WITH LATE HOURS AND A SURFEIT OF GENERALLY UNWHOLESOME GAIETY. THE NEXT DATED BOOKPLATE BY SKINNER BEARS THIS OUT ON THIS ENGRAVED IN  HE GIVES BATH AS HIS PLACE OF ABODE BUT THIS BOOKPLATE IS THAT OF FRANCIS MASSY OF RIXTON LANCASHIRE IT IS SIMILAR IN DESIGN TO THE CARINGTON JUST MENTIONED AND FIGURED.  BUT EARLIER IN STYLE THAN ANY OF SKINNERS WORK YET MENTIONED IS THE BOOKPLATE OF WILLIAM HILLARY M.D. DATED IN  HERE THE MANTLING DESCENDS NEARLY TO THE BASE OF THE SHIELD QUITE IN THE ARMORIAL STYLE. THIS SEEMS TO BE HIS LATEST WORK IN EARLY FASHION. IN  HE HAD DESIGNED A BOOKPLATE FOR JOHN WILLIAM FUHR IN WHICH THERE ARE CLEAR INDICATIONS OF CHIPPENDALE ORNAMENTATION. THIS IS INDEED A TRANSITIONAL BOOKPLATE IT HAS A JACOBEAN SHIELD WHICH THE ARTIST HAS ADORNED WITH CHIPPENDALE ORNAMENT THE TINCTURES ARE ONLY PARTIALLY EXPRESSED AND THE SHIELD REMAINS SYMMETRICAL THOUGH THE FLORAL SPRAYS AND SHELLWORK GIVE IT AT FIRST SIGHT THE APPEARANCE OF NOT BEING SO. IDENTICAL ALMOST WITH THIS BOOKPLATE IS THAT DONE BY SKINNER FOR HENRY PENNANT AND DATED IN  AND LIKE IT BUT WEAKER IS THAT OF THOS. HAVILAND BATH DATED IN THE SAME YEAR.  ILLUSTRATION  SKINNERS NEXT BOOKPLATES ARE THOSE OF CHARLES DELAFAYE ESQ. OF WICHBURY WILTS  JOHNSON ROBINSON  JOHN HUGHES OF BRECON ESQRE. AND BENJA ADAMSON  HEN. TOYE BRIDGEMAN ESQ. OF PRINCKNASH GLOUCESTERSHIRE  HENRY WALTERS ESQ. AND JOHN WODROOFE  AND THOS. FITZHERBERT ESQ. . ALL THESE LASTNAMED BOOKPLATES ARE MUCH ON A LEVEL AS REGARDS ARTISTIC MERIT AND THAT LEVEL IS NOT A HIGH ONE BENJAMIN ADAMSONS BOOKPLATE FIGURED ON P.  IS A FAIR EXAMPLE OF IT THOUGH IT IS NOT SO GOOD AS THE BRIDGEMAN BOOKPLATE OF THE SAME YEAR. IN  HOWEVER WE FIND A MORE NOTEWORTHY SPECIMEN OF SKINNERS WORK IN THE BOOKPLATE OF FRANCIS FLEMING. THERE IS A SCOTCH LOOK ABOUT THIS WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THE OWNER AND NOT THE ENGRAVER WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS DESIGN THE SHIELD IS ODDLY SHAPED AND IS ON A MEDALLION WHILST MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS OF VARIOUS KINDS ARE FIGURED BENEATH SIR WOLLASTON FRANKS POINTS OUT TO ME THAT THE FLEMING COAT OF ARMS HERE REPRESENTED IS BORNE ONLY BY THE FAMILY OF THE EARLS OF WIGTOWN. THE SAME YEAR  SKINNER DID AN ORDINARY CHIPPENDALE BOOKPLATE FOR DR. ROBERT GUSTHART WHOSE NAME APPEARS IN THE BATH GUIDE AS A DOCTOR IN PRACTICE THERE IN .  IN  SKINNER ENGRAVED A PLEASING CHIPPENDALE BOOKPLATE FOR WILLIAM OLIVER A SON OF HIS MORE FAMOUS NAMESAKE WHOSE BOOKPLATE ALSO BY SKINNER HAS BEEN ALREADY DESCRIBED IN THESE PAGES P. . YOUNG OLIVERS PLATE SHOWS A REMARKABLE FINENESS OF TOUCH AND IS ALTOGETHER IN VERY GOOD TASTENOT OVERORNAMENTED. TWO YEARS LATER WE HAVE THE LATEST KNOWN EXAMPLE OF SKINNERS WORK THE BOOKPLATE OF THE REVD I. DOBSON A.M. WHICH IS COARSE IN EXECUTION AND SUGGESTS THAT THE ARTISTS SKILL AS AN ENGRAVER WAS DIMINISHING.  ILLUSTRATION  OF THE TWENTYTWO KNOWN BOOKPLATES BY SKINNER ONLY TWO ARE UNDATED DR. OLIVERS ALREADY DESCRIBED P.  AND THAT OF SIR JOHN SMYTH BART. LL.D. THIS LAST HE MUST HAVE EXECUTED EARLY IN HIS CAREER. THE SHIELD BEARING THE ARMS STANDS UPON A PLATFORM AND IS JACOBEAN IN SHAPE AND ORNAMENTATION THE BACKGROUND IS SHADED. CLUMSILY DRAWN AND CLUMSILY POSED FEMALE FIGURES PARTLY DRAPED STAND UPON BRACKETLIKE EXCRESCENCES THAT SPRING FROM THE SHIELD WHILST CUPIDS RECLINE BELOW IT AND HOLD IT ALOFT.  WHAT HAPPENED TO SKINNER AFTER  I HAVE FAILED TO DISCOVER. HE IS CERTAINLY AN INTERESTING PERSON FROM A BOOKPLATE COLLECTORS POINT OF VIEW AND IT IS TO BE HOPED SOMETHING MORE ABOUT HIM MAY SOME DAY BE BROUGHT TO LIGHT. IN CONSIDERING HIS IDENTITY IT IS WORTH REMEMBERING THAT A LITTLE AFTER HIS DISAPPEARANCE VIZ. IN  ANOTHER WEST OF ENGLAND ENGRAVER NAMED SKINNERMATTHEW SKINNER OF EXETER IS FOUND WORKING ON BOOKPLATES. HE SIGNS THREE EXAMPLES ALL DESIGNED IN THE CHIPPENDALE STYLEJEAN ELI JAQURI DE MOUDON EN SUISSE N EN  SR EDMD THOMAS BART. AND PEREGRINE FRAS THORNE. THE TWO FIRST ARE ORDINARY CHIPPENDALE EXAMPLES BUT IN THE THIRD MANY IMPLEMENTS OF THE SOLDIERS ART ARE INTRODUCED.  ANOTHER VERY PROLIFIC ENGRAVER OF BOOKPLATESUNKNOWN EXCEPT IN THAT CAPACITYWAS ROBERT MOUNTAINE. HIS BOOKPLATES ARE FREQUENTLY DATED BUT THE DATES ARE PLACED IN THE MOST OBSCURE POSITIONS AND IN THE SMALLEST OF FIGURES SO IT NEEDS A CAREFUL STUDY OF THE ENGRAVINGS TO DISCOVER THEM. HE LABOURED WHOLLY IN THE CHIPPENDALE STYLE HIS TOUCH IS PECULIAR AND HIS TREATMENT GRACEFUL. ROUGHLY SPEAKING HE WORKED FROM  TO . HIS SIGNATURE VARIESSOMETIMES IT IS R.M. SOMETIMES MOUNTAINE.  THE FOLLOWING ARE A FEW OF HIS BOOKPLATES      HENRY BOWLES.     W. HARRISON D.D. FELLOW OF C. C. C. OXON.     R. C. COBBE.     S. J. COLLINS.     C. BLACKSTONE.     ED. GORE KIDDINGTON OXON.     JOHN DUTHY.     JOHN HOADLY LL.D. THIS IS DR. HOADLY THE VERSATILE         AUTHOR OF ORATORIOS AND COMEDIES.     SOPHIA PENN.     JOS. PORTAL.     C. S. POWLET ITCHEN.     GEO. POWLET ESQ.     JOHN STURGIS.  A LIST OF NEARLY SIXTY BOOKPLATES BY MOUNTAINE IS GIVEN IN THE EX LIBRIS JOURNAL II. P. .  HOGARTHS BOOKPLATES HAVE BEEN ALREADY DESCRIBED IN THIS VOLUME. THE W. H. WHO SIGNS CERTAIN EXAMPLES ONCE WRONGLY ASCRIBED TO HOGARTH WAS A CERTAIN WILLIAM HIBBART WHO LIKE SKINNER WAS A BATH ARTIST AND ETCHED PORTRAITS AFTER THE MANNER OF WORLIDGE. LORD DE TABLEY MENTIONS THAT WORLIDGE HIMSELF EXECUTED A BOOKPLATETHAT OF THE HONOURABLE HENRIETTA KNIGHTWHICH HE SIGNS IN FULL. WORLIDGE WAS CERTAINLY A DISTINGUISHED ENGRAVER HIS ETCHINGS AFTER REMBRANDT ARE EXCELLENT AND HIGHLY PRIZED. HE DIED IN .  THE WORK OF SIR ROBERT STRANGE AS A BOOKPLATE ENGRAVER HAS BEEN ALREADY REFERRED TO. BOTH LUMISDENS AND DR. DRUMMONDS BOOKPLATES WERE PROBABLY EXECUTED AFTER STRANGES DEPARTURE FROM ENGLAND AND THEREFORE AFTER . HIS CONTINENTAL VISIT WAS RENDERED NECESSARY OR AT LEAST EXPEDIENT BY THE MANNER IN WHICH HE HAD IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH THE STUART CAUSE DURING THE THEN RECENT TROUBLES. HE HAD JOINED THE JACOBITE LIFEGUARDS AND EMPLOYED HIS ARTISTIC ABILITY IN DESIGNING PAYNOTES FOR THE JACOBITE SOLDIERS. AFTER STUDYING SOME TIME IN PARIS UNDER LE BAS HE RETURNED TO ENGLAND WHERE HE REMAINED TILL . HE THEN WENT BACK TO THE CONTINENT WHERE HIS ABILITY WAS FREELY APPRECIATED AND WHERE HE WAS LOADED WITH DECORATIONS AT ROME AND FLORENCE. ENGLAND AT LENGTH RECOGNISED HIS MERIT AND IN  THE KING CONFERRED UPON HIM A KNIGHTHOOD WHICH HE LIVED FOR FIVE YEARS TO ENJOY. HIS DEVOTION TO THE HOUSE OF STUART NEVER ALTERED THE INSCRIPTION BENEATH ONE OF HIS MOST CELEBRATED PORTRAITS READS CHARLES JAMES EDWARD STUART CALLED THE YOUNG PRETENDER.  AFTER THE DAYS OF STRANGE AN INNUMERABLE NUMBER OF ARTISTS SIGN THEIR NAMES TO ENGLISH BOOKPLATES YET WITH THREE EXCEPTIONS THE NAMES OF NONE ARE KNOWN TO FAME TILL WE COME TO THOSE OF A COMPARATIVELY RECENT DATE. THE EXCEPTIONS ARE FRANCIS BARTOLOZZI JOHN KEYS SHERWIN AND THOMAS BEWICK. BARTOLOZZI THE MAN OF WHOM SIR ROBERT STRANGE DISPLAYED SUCH ILLCONCEALED JEALOUSY BEGAN TO WORK IN ENGLAND ABOUT FOUR YEARS AFTER THE ACCESSION OF GEORGE III. THOUGH IT WAS SOME YEARS BEFORE HIS WORTH WAS APPRECIATED BY THE PEOPLE WITH WHOM HE CAME TO RESIDE. NONE OF HIS BOOKPLATES BELONG TO A DATE PRIOR TO  OR . HE REMOVED TO LISBON IN  TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY AND WHILE THERE IT WILL BE REMEMBERED ENGRAVED AN ENGLISHMANS BOOKPLATE IN  SEE P. . HIS DEATH TOOK PLACE AT LISBON IN . SHERWIN WAS BORN IN POVERTY AND OWING LARGELY TO HIS OWN FOLLY DIED IN IT AFTER HAVING AT ONE TIME AMASSED A CONSIDERABLE SUM OF MONEY. HE WAS A PUPIL OF BARTOLOZZI GAINED THE ROYAL ACADEMY GOLD MEDAL IN  AND WAS APPOINTED ENGRAVER TO THE KING IN OR ABOUT . HIS BOOKPLATE WORK IS REFERRED TO AT P. .  THOMAS BEWICK WHO AS WE HAVE SEEN PP.  WAS THE MOST PROLIFIC OF ANY ENGLISH ENGRAVER OF BOOKPLATES WAS BORN AT CHERRY BURN IN NORTHUMBERLAND IN  AND DIED IN . THE INCIDENTS IN HIS HISTORY ARE TOO WELL KNOWN TO NEED REPETITION HERE AND HIS WORK UPON BOOKPLATES HAS BEEN ALREADY MENTIONED. IT MAY BE HOWEVER NOTICED THAT HIS EARLIEST BOOKPLATE IS DATED IN  THE YEAR IN WHICH HE PUBLISHED THE FIRST VOLUME OF HIS BRITISH BIRDS.  FOOTNOTE   SEE ARTICLE IN BIBLIOGRAPHICA VOL. II. P. .     CHAPTER XIII  ODDS AND ENDS   ODDS AND ENDS THE COMPILER OF A VOLUME OF THIS SORT IS SURE TO FIND PLENTY OF THESESCRAPS WORTH PUTTING IN SOMEWHERE YET NOT COMING PRECISELY UNDER ANY PARTICULAR HEAD. IN THE FIRST PLACE PORTRAIT BOOKPLATES CLAIM ATTENTION. WE HAVE SEEN THAT THEY EXIST BUT ALAS THAT THEY ARE SO FEW FOR TO ANY REASONABLE PERSON MEMBERS OF THE HERALDS COLLEGE OF COURSE EXCEPTED A MANS FEATURES ARE CERTAINLY MORE INTERESTING THAN HIS ARMORIAL BEARINGS. IN ENGLAND SAM. PEPYS ADOPTED THE STYLE WHICH WAS NOT THEN UNKNOWN ON THE CONTINENT. PIRCKHEIMER PERHAPS ORIGINATED IT BY PLACING AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID A PORTRAIT OF HIMSELF AT THE END OF THE VOLUMES WHICH CONTAINED HIS NOW FAMILIAR BOOKPLATE BY DRER ON THE FRONT COVER AND THERE ARE MANY OTHER EARLY FOREIGN EXAMPLES. ONE OF THE MOST CONSPICUOUS IS THE BUSTPORTRAIT OF JOHN VENNITZER OF NUREMBERG ENGRAVED BY PFANN AND DATED IN  TO WHICH I HAVE ALREADY ALLUDED P. . PEPYS USED TO PLACE THE SMALL VARIETY OF HIS PORTRAIT BOOKPLATETHAT FIGURED OPPOSITEAT THE COMMENCEMENT OF MANY OF HIS BOOKS AND THAT SHOWING HIS INTERWOVEN INITIALS THE LITTLE PLATE FOR MY BOOKS AT THE END. BOTH HIS PORTRAIT BOOKPLATES ARE BY WHITE. I HAVE FAILED TO FIND ANY ALLUSION IN HIS DIARY TO THE ENGRAVING OF THESE BOOKPLATES THOUGH AS WE HAVE SEEN HE REFERS TO THE PREPARATION OF ANOTHER SEE P. . HE VERY LIKELY TOOK THE IDEA OF A PORTRAIT BOOKPLATE FROM THAT WHICH FAITHORNE EITHER IN OR SOON AFTER  PREPARED TO PLACE IN THE VOLUMES LEFT BY GOOD BISHOP HACKET TO CAMBRIDGE SEE P. .  ILLUSTRATION  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE HAVE A PORTRAIT IN THE FIGURE ON THE BOOKPLATE ALREADY NOTICED OF LOUIS BOSCH A CLERGYMAN OF TAMISE NEAR ANTWERP BUT THE HEAD IS TOO SMALL TO AFFORD AN INTERESTING LIKENESS. THE PRIEST SITS AT A TABLE IN HIS STUDY THE WALLS OF WHICH ARE LINED WITH VOLUMES AND BENEATH HIM IS WRITTEN IN LATIN A HUNT IN SUCH A FOREST NEVER WEARIESTHE FOREST BEING AS LORD DE TABLEY OBSERVES THE ROWS AND RANKS OF HIS REVERENCES BOOKS. IN FRANCE THE PORTRAIT BOOKPLATE IS NOT UNCOMMON THAT OF A FRENCH CLERGYMAN FRANCIS PERRAULT FIGURED OPPOSITE IS A NICE PIECE OF WORK AND BEARS THE DATE  BUT PORTRAITS POSSIBLY OR INDEED PROBABLY OF THE OWNERS OCCUR ON FRENCH BOOKPLATES AT AN EARLIER DATE. IN ITALY THERE IS AN EXAMPLE IN  THE BOOKPLATE OF FILIPPO LINARTI.  ILLUSTRATION  AN INSTANCE OF THE USE OF THE PORTRAIT BOOKPLATE IN ENGLAND DURING THE LAST CENTURY IS AFFORDED BY THAT OF JACOBUS GIBBS ARCHITECTUS  WHICH IS FOUND IN THE ARCHITECTURAL BOOKS BEQUEATHED BY THE POSSESSOR TO THE RADCLIFFE LIBRARY AT OXFORD A BUILDING WHICH HE DESIGNED. JAMES GIBBS WAS BORN AT ABERDEEN IN  BUT CAME SOUTH EARLY IN HIS CAREER AND LONDONERS MAY SEE EXAMPLES OF HIS WORK IN THE CHURCHES OF ST. MARTININTHEFIELDS AND ST. MARY LE STRAND. HE ALSO BUILT THE SENATE HOUSE AT CAMBRIDGE. HE DIED IN . ON HIS BOOKPLATE WHICH IS OBLONG IN SHAPE AND MIGHT WELL FORM THE HEADPIECE TO A PREFACE THE PORTRAIT APPEARS IN A MEDALLION SURROUNDED BY SHELL AND SCROLLWORK. THE ENGRAVER WHO SIGNS HIS INITIALS B. B. WAS BERNARD BARON A FRENCHMAN WHO CAME TO ENGLAND IN  AND ENGRAVED HOGARTHS PORTRAIT OF GIBBS.  THE RESUSCITATOR OF PORTRAIT BOOKPLATES IN ENGLAND IN RECENT TIMES WAS THE LATE MR. THOMS. THAT VETERAN ANTIQUARY TELLS IN A LETTER TO THE ATHENUM HOW HE CAME TO USE AS A BOOKPLATE A PHOTOGRAPH OF HIMSELF TAKEN BY DR. DIAMOND IN THE VERY EARLY DAYS OF PHOTOGRAPHY. BENEATH THIS HE PLACED AN INSCRIPTION SETTING FORTH THAT THE VOLUME IN WHICH IT WAS FASTENED WAS FOR THE USE OF HIMSELF AND HIS FRIENDSA REPETITION OF THE SENTIMENT ON ONE OF THE PIRCKHEIMER BOOKPLATES SIBI ET AMICIS. WE DO NOT OF COURSE KNOW HOW FAR PIRCKHEIMER MEANT WHAT HE SAID BUT WE DO KNOW ANY OF US WHO EVER ASKED THE LOAN OF A VOLUME FROM MR. THOMS THAT THE SENTIMENT WAS BY HIM REALLY MEANT. NO WORTHY BOOKBORROWER EVER MET WITH REFUSAL FROM THAT EVER COURTEOUS LITERARY ENTHUSIAST.  AFTER CONSIDERING PORTRAIT BOOKPLATES THE COLLECTOR MAY TURN HIS ATTENTION TO THE STUDY OF THE BOOKPLATES THAT HAVE BELONGED TO INTERESTING MEN. I HAVE SPOKEN OF MANY OF THESE IN REACHING THIS POINT IN MY VOLUME BUT TO THE NAMES ALREADY MENTIONED MAY BE ADDED SOME MORE CHARLES EARL OF DORSET AND MIDDLESEX WHO AS LORD BUCKHURST WAS A PROMINENT FIGURE AT THE DULL COURT OF DUTCH WILLIAM SAVED DRYDEN FROM RUIN AND INTRODUCED MAT PRIOR TO SOCIETY. THEN THERE IS ROBERT HARLEYGREAT MINISTER GREAT STATESMAN AND UNDERMINER OF THE WHIG POWER FOUNDER OF THE COLLECTION OF BOOKS AND MANUSCRIPTS WHICH NOW BEARS HIS NAME. THE INSCRIPTION ON HIS BOOKPLATE READS ROBERT HARLEY OF BRAMPTON CASTLE IN THE COUNTY OF HEREFORD ESQRE IT IS FOUND IN TWO SIZESONE FOR FOLIO VOLUMES AND ANOTHER FOR THOSE OF SMALLER SIZE. ITS DATE MAY BE FIXED AT THE VERY CLOSE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.  THEN WE HAVE THE BOOKPLATE OF SIR THOMAS HANMER THE SPEAKER A BOLD PIECE OF WORK IN THE SIMPLE ARMORIAL STYLE DATED . HANMER WAS BORN IN  SO THAT HIS BOOKPLATE WAS EXECUTED WHEN HE WAS IN HIS THIRTYFIRST YEARTHAT IS SIX YEARS PRIOR TO HIS FIRST ENTRY OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND PROBABLY BEFORE HE HAD MADE MUCH USE OF THE LIBRARY WITH WHICH HIS NAME WAS AFTERWARDS ASSOCIATED WHEN TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF HIS LIFE HE CEASED TO BE A MAN OF POLITICS AND BECAME A MAN OF LETTERS. HE DIED IN  LEAVING COMPLETED HIS EDITION OF SHAKESPEARES WORKS IN HALF A DOZEN VOLUMES.  WITH THE BOOKPLATE OF SIR THOMAS HANMER WE MAY APPROPRIATELY CONSIDER THAT OF SIR PAUL METHUEN THE SOLDIER AND MINISTER OF ANNE AND GEORGE I. WITH WHOM HANMER MUST HAVE BEEN FREQUENTLY BROUGHT IN CONTACT. METHUENS BOOKPLATE IS ALTOGETHER MORE EXCEPTIONAL IN STYLE THAN HANMERS THE MANTLING AFTER BEING BLOWN ABOUT BY A STRONG WIND ENDS REGULARLY IN TASSELS CURIOUS CREATURES FIGURE IN THE DESIGN AND THE BRACKET ON WHICH RESTS THE SHIELD IS UPHELD BY A MALE AND A FEMALE ANGEL.  METHUENS BOOKPLATE WAS ENGRAVED ABOUT . FIVE YEARS LATER WE FIND THAT OF JOHN LORD BOYLE WHO THOUGH BY MEANS OF THE QUARREL WITH HIS FATHER HE WAS ROBBED OF THE BOYLE LIBRARY HAD WHILST YET A YOUNG MAN A SUFFICIENT STOCK OF VOLUMES OF HIS OWN TO NECESSITATE THE USE OF A DISTINGUISHING MARK FOR THEM. HIS BOOKPLATE IS BY JOHN HULETT AN INDIFFERENT ENGRAVER.  MATTHEW PRIORS BOOKPLATE NOW CLAIMS ATTENTION INDEED IF THESE BOOKPLATES OF CELEBRITIES WERE TAKEN IN STRICTLY CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED BEFORE THAT OF SIR PAUL METHUEN. IN STYLE IT IS EARLY JACOBEAN SO THAT WE MAY DATE IT AT SAY  THOUGH THERE IS NOTHING IN THE INSCRIPTIONMATTHEW PRIOR ESQ.TO SHOW TO WHAT PARTICULAR PERIOD IN THE THIN HOLLOWLOOKED MANS LIFE IT BELONGS. BUT IT IS TEMPTING TO PLACE IT AT THE CLOSE OF HIS CAREER AS A DIPLOMATIST WHEN HE WAS SETTLING DOWN ON THE SMALL COUNTRY PROPERTY THAT HARLEY HAD BOUGHT FOR HIM AND WAS RICH ON THE PROCEEDS OF THE SUBSCRIPTION TO HIS HUGE VOLUME OF OCCASIONAL POEMS.  AFTER PRIORS BOOKPLATE WE DO NOT MEET WITH ANOTHER OF A CELEBRITY FOR A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF YEARS. ONE APPEARS AT LAST IN THAT ENGRAVEDPROBABLY BY A SCOTCH ENGRAVER ABOUT THE YEAR FOR THE LUCKLESS LORD LOVAT WHO LOST HIS HEAD ON TOWER HILL AFTER THE SECOND SCOTCH REBELLION. THE INSCRIPTION DESERVES CONSIDERATION BECAUSE IT IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE MAN THE RIGHT HONOURABLE SIMON LORD FRASER OF LOVAT CHIEF OF THE ANCIENT CLAN OF THE FRASERS GOVERNOR OF INVERNESS ETC. MARK THE WAY IN WHICH HE EMPHASISES HIS HEADSHIP OF THE CLAN CAN HE IN THOSE EARLY DAYS HAVE HEARD WHISPERINGS OF A STORY THAT HE HAD AN ELDER BROTHER WHO WAS IN HIDING LEST THE LAW SHOULD METE OUT TO HIM ITS PENALTY FOR MURDER ANYHOW IT IS A FINE BOLD BOOKPLATE MORE IN THE STYLE OF ENGLISH BOOKPLATES OF A DOZEN YEARS EARLIER A HEAVY ERMINELINED MANTLE OF ESTATE FALLS FROM THE BACK OF THE HELMET AND ENCLOSES BOTH SHIELD AND SUPPORTERS.  JOHN WILKES HAD THREE BOOKPLATES AND WHAT IS REMARKABLE THEY ALL MAKE DISPLAY OF THE WILKES ARMORIAL BEARINGS. ONE WOULD FANCY THAT THE GREAT DEMAGOGUE WOULD AT LEAST IN THE DECORATION OF THE SHIELD DISPLAY BOMBS KEGS OF GUNPOWDER PHRYGIAN CAPS OR OTHER EMBLEMS OF THE MANIFESTATION AND ENJOYMENT OF LIBERTY BUT IT IS NOT SO. LAWRENCE STERNES BOOKPLATE IS CERTAINLY MORE APPROPRIATE. HERE WE HAVE THE BUST OF A YOUNG MAN WHOM LORD DE TABLEY CONSIDERS TO BE EITHER JUVENAL OR MARTIAL PLACED ON A SLAB ON EITHER SIDE OF WHICH ARE CLOSED VOLUMES ONE INSCRIBED ALAS POOR YORICK AND THE OTHER TRISTRAM SHANDY. NO DOUBT THIS BOOKPLATE WAS ENGRAVED IN OR ABOUT THE YEAR  WHEN STERNE HAD BOUGHTAS HE TOLD A CORRESPONDENTSEVEN HUNDRED BOOKS DOG CHEAP AND MANY GOOD WHICH HE WAS THEN BUSY ARRANGING IN THE BEST ROOM AT COXWOULD. SAMUEL ROGERSS BOOKPLATE IS IN THE WREATH AND RIBBON STYLE. WILLIAM COWPERS IS A LITTLE LATER AND SHOWS US A PLAIN SHIELD WITHOUT THE FESTOONDECORATION. HIS MUST BECOME A SCARCE BOOKPLATE FOR HE HAD BUT FEW BOOKSONLY  AT HIS DEATH AND THE BOOKPLATE DOES NOT APPEAR IN ALL PERHAPS HE BEGAN TO INSERT IT BUT WAS STOPPED BY LOSS OF REASON. MR. BOLTON SUGGESTS THAT THE BOOKPLATE MAY BE THE WORK OF THOMAS PARK AN ENGRAVER WHO HE REMINDS US OFFERED TO DO ANYTHING FOR COWPER IN THE WAY OF HIS ART AS A LABOUR OF LOVE SO MUCH DID HE APPRECIATE THE POETS WRITINGS. BYRONS BOOKPLATE ALLUDED TO ELSEWHERE IS WITHOUT ONE REMARKABLE FEATURE WHETHER OR NOT IT IS THAT SENT HIM BY THE FAIR ADMIRER ALREADY REFERRED TO P.  ONE CANNOT SAY. THOMAS CARLYLES BOOKPLATE WAS ENGRAVED IN  BY H. P. WALKER.  ONE MIGHT EXTEND A LIST OF CELEBRITIES WHO HAVE USED BOOKPLATES AD INFINITUM BUT THERE IS NO NEED TO ATTEMPT THAT PROCESS HERE THOUGH IT MIGHT BE AS WELL TO POINT OUT THAT CERTAIN BOOKPLATES INSCRIBED WITH THE NAMES OF CELEBRITIES WHICH HAVE INDUCED COLLECTORS TO SPEAK OF THEM AS THE BOOKPLATES OF THESE DISTINGUISHED PERSONS CANNOT REALLY HAVE BEEN MADE FOR THEM. THERE IS FOR INSTANCE AN EARLY CHIPPENDALE BOOKPLATE INSCRIBED WILLIAM WILBERFORCE WHICH IS OR PERHAPS I SHOULD SAY USED TO BE CONSTANTLY SPOKEN OF AS THE BOOKPLATE OF THE FAMOUS MAN WHO WAS BOLD ENOUGH TO SUGGEST THAT ENGLANDS COLONIES COULD GET ON VERY WELL WITHOUT THE PRESENCE OF SLAVERY. NOW THIS BOOKPLATE IS VERY LITTLE IF ANY LATER THAN  AND THE GREAT EMANCIPATOR WAS NOT BORN TILL  AS A MATTER OF FACT IT WAS PROBABLY ENGRAVED FOR HIS GRANDFATHER WILLIAM WILBERFORCE OF HULL. A GREAT MANY SPECIMENS BEAR HIS SIGNATURE WRITTEN AT THE TOP OF THE BOOKPLATE. THEN TO GIVE ONE MORE INSTANCE THERE IS THE BOOKPLATE INSCRIBED CAPT. COOK AND IN THIS YOU ARE TOLD TO SEE THE MARK OF OWNERSHIP WHICH THE ONCE POPULAR HERO PLACED IN THE VOLUMES THAT COMPOSED HIS LIBRARY BUT SO FAR AS THE EVIDENCE OF THIS BOOKPLATE GOES CAPTAIN COOK MAY NEVER HAVE HAD A LIBRARY AT ALL. IT BEARS ARMS HIGHLY APPROPRIATE TO A NAVIGATOR BUT THEY WERE NOT GRANTED TO THE COOK FAMILY TILL  AND AS EVERY READER OF TRAVEL KNOWS CAPTAIN COOK WAS MURDERED IN . IN ALL PROBABILITY THIS BOOKPLATE WAS ENGRAVED FOR THE NAVIGATORS SON JAMES COOK WHO IN  ATTAINED TO THE RANK OF COMMANDER IN THE NAVY  BE IT SAID ISTO JUDGE FROM ITS STYLE AND DECORATIONABOUT THE DATE OF THE BOOKPLATE.  BOOKPLATES OF ENGLISH PARISH LIBRARIES AND INSTITUTIONS DESERVE SOME NOTICE FOR SEVERAL REASONS. IN THESE DAYS WHEN ENTHUSIASM FOR THE ERECTION OF FREE LIBRARIES IS SO GREAT IT IS CURIOUS TO BE REMINDED OF THE PAST AND LONGFORGOTTEN EFFORTS OF OUR ANCESTORS TO CIVILISE THEIR NEIGHBOURS BY THE USE OF BOOKS. GLOOMY AFFAIRS MOST OF THESE PARISH LIBRARIES ARE NOW YOU STILL SOMETIMES FIND THEM LOCKED IN A DAMP VESTRY OR IN A COUNTRY VICARAGE WHERE THEIR EXISTENCE IS A SECRET TO THE PARISHIONERS AND INDEED TO MOST OTHER PEOPLE. THE BOOKPLATES OF SOME OF THEM ARE INTERESTING. THERE IS A NEAT DESIGN IN THE JACOBEAN STYLE WHICH SHOWS US THE SHIELD DIVIDED AND CONTAINS ON THE SINISTER SIDE TWO CROSSED KEYS AND ON THE DEXTER TWO CROSSED SWORDS. THIS IS INSCRIBED SWAFFHAM LIBRARY. T. DALTON F. RAYNER CHURCHWARDENS . AT LEAST TWO DESIGNS FOR THESE PARISH BOOKPLATES ARE BY SIMON GRIBELIN. IN ONE WE HAVE ST. JOHN IN THE ISLE OF PATMOS AND IN THE OTHER AN UNIDENTIFIABLE FIGURE KNEELING IN PRAYER. TO EACH THE ARTIST HAS PLACED HIS INITIALS S. G. AND BOTH BELONG TO ABOUT THE SAME DATE.  A GREAT MANY OF THESE PAROCHIAL LIBRARIES WERE FOUNDED EARLY IN THE LAST CENTURY BY DR. THOMAS BRAY DURING HIS LIFETIME AND BY A BODY CALLING THEMSELVES THE ASSOCIATES OF DR. BRAY AFTER HIS DEATH. IT WAS AT BRAYS INSTANCE THAT THE ACT OF  ANNE FOR THE BETTER PRESERVATION OF PAROCHIAL LIBRARIES WAS PASSED BY PARLIAMENT. ONE OF THE EARLIEST OF THE FOUNDATIONS UNDER IT WAS IN .  IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE ASSOCIATES ISSUED BOOKPLATES FOR PLACING IN THE VOLUMES OF THE DIFFERENT LIBRARIES ESTABLISHED FOR THERE IS IN THE DESIGN A SPACE LEFT BLANK FOR THE INSERTION WITH PEN AND INK OF THE NAME OF THE PARTICULAR LIBRARY USING THE BOOKPLATE. THESE BOOKPLATES GENERALLY BEAR TEXTS OR SOME APPROPRIATE WORDS SUCH AS ACCIPE LIBRUM ET DEVORA ILLUM REV. X.  THE SCENE DEPICTED BEING ST. JOHN IN THE ISLE OF PATMOS RECEIVING THE BOOK FROM THE ANGEL OR SOMETIMES A REMINDER TO THE BORROWER THAT HE NEEDS TO DO MORE THAN BORROW THE VOLUME IN ORDER TO PROFIT BY ITS CONTENTS SUCH AS TOLLE LEGE WHICH APPEARS ON THE BOOKPLATE OF THE PARISH LIBRARY OF WEOBLEY  GROTESQUE HERALDRY IS NOT OFTEN MET WITH IN ENGLAND ON GENUINE BOOKPLATES. WE HAVE SEEN THAT ON MANY EXAMPLES THE DECORATIVE ACCESSORIES OF THE SHIELD HAVE A CERTAIN APPROPRIATENESS TO THE OWNER BESIDES THIS THE ARMS BORNE HAVE FREQUENTLY A DIRECT REFERENCE TO THE BEARERS NAME. BUT GROTESQUE HERALDRY SUCH AS THAT WHICH HOGARTH WAS SO FOND OF DESIGNING IS CERTAINLY RARE IN ENGRAVINGS PREPARED FOR BOOKPLATES. THERE IS HOWEVER ONE EXAMPLE OF SUCH HERALDRY ON AN ENGLISH BOOKPLATE WHICH IS WORTH REFERRING TOI MEAN THE VERY INTERESTING EXAMPLE FIGURED ON P. . THIS BELONGED TO THE SHOEMAKERPOET ROBERT BLOOMFIELD AND CERTAINLY THE ARMS UPON IT ARE BOTH GROTESQUE AND APPROPRIATE TO THE OWNER SINCE THEY COMMEMORATE HIS ONLY REALLY SUCCESSFUL LITERARY EFFORT THE FARMERS BOY. LOOK FOR A MOMENT AT THE DETAILS FOR THEY REPAY INSPECTION. A FIGURE ON COWBACK HOLDING A SHOE ON THE END OF A STICK DOES DUTY AS A CREST TWO PLOUGHMEN ACT AS SUPPORTERS WHILST THE BEARINGS ON THE SHIELD REPRESENT EVERY VARIETY OF AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT EVERY OCCUPANT OF A FARMYARD ORDINARILY MET WITH AND VARIOUS TOOLS CONNECTED WITH THE OWNERS CRAFT BESIDES ON THE SINISTER HALF OF THE SHIELD IS A COBBLER IN AN ATTITUDE SUGGESTIVE OF HIS HAVING DONE FULL JUSTICE TO A FEAST IN HONOUR OF ST. CRISPINNOT CONDUCTED ON TOTAL ABSTINENCE PRINCIPLES. THE QUARTERINGS ALSO INCLUDE THREE OPEN VOLUMES AND ACROSS THE PAGES OF ONE IS PRINTED FARMERS BOY. THE WHOLEEVEN TO ITS MOTTO A FIG FOR THE HERALDSIS MOST CHARACTERISTIC OF BLOOMFIELD AND WAS ENGRAVED FOR HIM IN TEN YEARS BEFORE HIS DEATHBY A CHEAPSIDE ENGRAVER.  ILLUSTRATION                                       WITH THIS GATHERING TOGETHER OF SCRAPS AND CLIPPINGS I WILL BRING MY VOLUME TO A CLOSE. MOST OF WHAT I HAVE SAID AND A VERY GREAT DEAL BESIDES IS WELL KNOWN TO THE STUDENTS OF BOOKPLATES BUT TO THEM I FANCY THIS WORK IS NOT INTENDED TO APPEAL. IT IS MEANT FOR THE PUBLIC AT LARGE TO THE MAJORITY OF WHOM BOOKPLATES ARE UNCONSIDERED TRIFLES. TO PROMOTE WHOLESALE BOOKPLATE COLLECTING IN ALBUMS AND PORTFOLIOS IS CERTAINLY NOT MY INTENTION. IF IT WERE IT WOULD BE A VERY UNDESIRABLE INTENTION FOR SO FAR AS IT SUCCEEDED IT WOULD UNQUESTIONABLY LEAD TO THE WHOLESALE DISFIGUREMENT AND DESTRUCTION OF BOOKS WITHOUT REGARD TO THEIR VALUE. WHAT I HAVE AIMED AT IS TO AWAKEN A WIDER INTEREST IN BOOKPLATES AND A WIDER OBSERVATION OF THEM IN THEIR ABIDING PLACES BY THOSE WHO EITHER POSSESS THEM ALREADY OR ACQUIRE THEM HEREAFTER. IF I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN DOING THIS MY WORK WILL I AM VAIN ENOUGH TO BELIEVE BE NOT ALTOGETHER UNSUCCESSFUL FOR BOOKPLATES POSSESS REALLY AN ARTISTIC AND GENERAL INTEREST WHICH WILL BE HEIGHTENED THE MORE OUR STOCK OF KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING THEM IS INCREASED.
