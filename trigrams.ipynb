OF BOOKS ABOUT BOOKS.PREFACEHAVING VINDICATED IN MY INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER THE PRACTICE OF COLLECTINGBOOKPLATES FROM THE CHARGE OF FLAGRANT IMMORALITY I DO NOT THINK ITNECESSARY TO SPEND MANY WORDS IN DEMONSTRATING THAT IT IS IN EVERY WAY AWORTHY AND REASONABLE PURSUIT AND ONE WHICH FULLY DESERVES TO BE MADETHE SUBJECT OF A SPECIAL TREATISE IN A SERIES OF BOOKS ABOUT BOOKS. IFNEED WERE THE EDITOR OF THE SERIES WHO ASKED ME TO WRITE THIS LITTLEHANDBOOK WOULD PERHAPS KINDLY ACCEPT HIS SHARE OF RESPONSIBILITY BUTIN THE FACE OF THE EXISTENCE OF A FLOURISHING EX LIBRIS SOCIETY THEIMPORTANCE OF THE BOOKPLATE AS AN OBJECT OF COLLECTION MAY ALMOST BETAKEN AS AXIOMATIC. MY OWN INTEREST IN THIS PARTICULAR HOBBY IS OF LONGSTANDING AND HAPPILY THE APPEARANCE WHEN MY MANUSCRIPT WAS ALREADY ATTHE PRINTERS OF MR. EGERTON CASTLES PLEASANTLY WRITTEN AND PROFUSELYILLUSTRATED WORK ON ENGLISH BOOKPLATES HAS RELIEVED ME OF THE DREADEDNECESSITY OF WRITING AN ADDITIONAL CHAPTER ON THOSE MODERN EXAMPLES INTREATING OF WHICH NEITHER MY KNOWLEDGE NOR MY ENTHUSIASM WOULD HAVEEQUALLED HIS.THE DESIRE TO POSSESS A BOOKPLATE OF ONES OWN IS IN ITSELF COMMENDABLEENOUGH FOR IN FIXING THE FIRST COPY INTO THE FIRST BOOK THE OWNER MAYSURELY BE ASSUMED TO HAVE REGISTERED A VOW THAT HE OR SHE AT LEAST WILLNOT JOIN THE GREAT ARMY OF BOOKPERSECUTORSMEN AND WOMEN WHO CANNOTTOUCH A VOLUME WITHOUT MALTREATING IT AND WHO THOUGH THEY ARE OFTENREADY TO DESCRIBE THE REMOVAL OF A BOOKPLATE EVEN FROM A WORTHLESSVOLUME AS AN ACT OF VANDALISM DO INFINITELY MORE HARM TO BOOKS INGENERAL BY THEIR RUTHLESS HANDLING OF THEM. NO DOUBT ALSO THE DECAY OFINTEREST IN HERALDRY WHICH IS MAINLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ECCENTRICITIESOF MODERN FANCY EXAMPLES HAS TAKEN FROM US THE TEMPTATION TO COMMITCERTAIN SINS WHICH WERE AT ONE TIME ATTRACTIVE. OUR ANCESTORS FORINSTANCE MAY SOMETIMES HAVE OUTRAGED THE SUSCEPTIBILITIES OF THEHERALDS BY USING AS BOOKPLATES COATSOFARMS TO WHICH THEY HAD NOTITLE. YET THEIR OFFENCE AGAINST THE COLLEGE OF ARMS WAS TRIVIAL WHENCOMPARED WITH THE OUTRAGE UPON COMMONSENSE COMMITTED BY THE MYSTICALYOUNG MAN OF TODAY WHO DESIGNS OR HAS DESIGNED FOR HIM ANEMBLEMATIC BOOKPLATE OR A SYMBOLIC BOOKPLATE OR A THEORETICBOOKPLATE IN WHICH THE EMBLEM OR THE SYMBOL OR THE THEORY IS FARTOO MYSTICAL FOR ANY ORDINARY COMPREHENSION AND NEEDS IN FACT ALENGTHY EXPLANATION WHICH HOWEVER I AM BOUND TO CONFESS IS ALWAYSVERY WILLINGLY GIVEN BY EITHER OWNER OR DESIGNER IF ASKED FOR.IT IS PERHAPS NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT I AM VERY FAR FROM INCLUDING ALLMODERN BOOKPLATES UNDER THIS CONDEMNATION. THE NAMES OF THEARTISTSSIR JOHN MILLAIS MR. STACY MARKS RANDOLPH CALDECOTT MR.WALTER CRANE MISS KATE GREENAWAY AND OTHERSWHO HAVE FOUND TIME TODESIGN SOME OF THEM ONLY ONE SOME QUITE A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OFREALLY INTERESTING MARKS OF OWNERSHIP SUFFICE TO RESCUE MODERNBOOKPLATES FROM ENTIRE DISCREDIT. HERE AND THERE TOO A LITTLEKNOWNARTIST LIKE THE LATE MR. WINTER OF NORWICH HAS PRODUCED A SINGULARLYFINE PLATE. ABOVE ALL THE STRIKINGLY BEAUTIFUL WORK OF MR. SHERBORN ASSEEN IN THE BOOKPLATES OF THE DUKE OF WESTMINSTER IN THAT OF MR.WILLIAM ROBINSON AND IN MANY OTHER FINE EXAMPLES FORMS A REFRESHINGOASIS IN THE DESERT OF WILD ECCENTRICITY. BUT THE MOST ARDENT ADMIRER OFMODERN BOOKPLATES CANNOT PRETEND THAT AMID THE MULTIPLICITY OF RECENTEXAMPLES ANY SCHOOL OR STYLE IS OBSERVABLE AND AS I HAVE AIMED ATGIVING IN THIS LITTLE HANDBOOK AN HISTORIC SKETCH HOWEVERUNPRETENTIOUS OF THE DIFFERENT STYLES ADOPTED IN DESIGNING BOOKPLATESFROM THEIR FIRST INTRODUCTION I HOPE I MAY BE EXCUSED FOR NOT HAVINGATTEMPTED TO TRACE THEIR HISTORY BEYOND THE EARLY YEARS OF THE PRESENTCENTURY AFTER WHICH NO DISTINCTIVE STYLE CAN BE SAID TO EXIST.AS I HAVE SAID ELSEWHERE IT HAS BEEN NO PART OF MY OBJECT IN WRITING MYBOOK TO ADVOCATE INDISCRIMINATE COLLECTING. BUT FOR THOSE WHO AREALREADY COLLECTORS I HAVE ONE WORD OF ADVICE ON THE SUBJECT OF THEARRANGEMENT OF THEIR TREASURES. SOME ENTHUSIASTS ADVOCATE ACHRONOLOGICAL ARRANGEMENT OTHERS A GENEALOGICAL OTHERS ATOPOGRAPHICAL AND THE ADVOCATES OF EACH THEORY PASTE DOWN THEIRSPECIMENS IN SCRAPBOOKS OR OTHER VOLUMES IN ADHERENCE TO THEIR OWNVIEWS. NOW THERE IS A GREAT DEAL TO BE SAID IN FAVOUR OF EACH OF THESECLASSIFICATIONS SO MUCH INDEED THAT NO SYSTEM IS PERFECT WHICH DOESNOT ADMIT OF A COLLECTION BEING ARRANGED ACCORDING TO ONE PLAN TODAYAND ANOTHER TOMORROWI.E. NO ARRANGEMENT IS SATISFACTORY WHICH ISNECESSARILY PERMANENT. LET EACH SPECIMEN BE LIGHTLY YET FIRMLY FIXEDON A SEPARATE SHEET OF CARDBOARD OR STOUT PAPER OF SUFFICIENT SIZE TOTAKE THE LARGEST BOOKPLATES COMMONLY MET WITH. THESE CARDS OR SHEETSMAY BE KEPT A HUNDRED OR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TOGETHER IN PORTFOLIOS ORBOXES WHICH SHOULD BE DISTINCTLY NUMBERED. EACH CARD OR SHEET SHOULDALSO BE PAGED AND BEAR THE NUMBER OF THE PORTFOLIO TO WHICH IT BELONGS.THE COLLECTOR CAN BY THIS MEANS ASCERTAIN WHEN HE PLEASES IF ALL HISPORTFOLIOS CONTAIN THEIR PROPER NUMBER OF CARDS OR SHEETS AND HE CANARRANGE HIS SPECIMENS ACCORDING TO THE PARTICULAR POINT OF INTEREST INHIS COLLECTION WHICH FROM TIME TO TIME HE MAY DESIRE TO ILLUSTRATE. INADDITION TO THIS THE SYSTEM OF SINGLE CARDS HAS OBVIOUS ADVANTAGES FORTHE PURPOSE OF MINUTE STUDY AND COMPARISON.IN CONCLUSION IT ONLY REMAINS FOR ME TO EXPRESS MY WARM THANKS TO LORDDE TABLEY AND TO MR. A. W. FRANKS C.B. TO THE FORMER FOR ALLOWING METO MAKE USE WITHOUT OFTREPEATED ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE MATTERCONTAINED IN HIS GUIDE TO THE STUDY OF BOOKPLATES A SECOND AND MUCHAMPLIFIED EDITION OF WHICH WE MAY HOPE WILL BEFORE LONG MAKE ITSAPPEARANCE TO THE LATTER NOT ONLY FOR CONSTANT ADVICE AND ASSISTANCEBUT ALSO FOR THE LOAN FROM HIS COLLECTION OF NEARLY ALL THE BOOKPLATESWITH REPRODUCTIONS OF WHICH THIS VOLUME IS ILLUSTRATED.

ROBERT BLOOMFIELD                             BOOKPLATESCHAPTER IINTRODUCTORYBOOKPLATE COLLECTING AT LEAST IN THIS COUNTRY IS A THING OFYESTERDAY. ON THE CONTINENT PARTICULARLY IN FRANCE IT ATTRACTEDATTENTION SUFFICIENTLY SERIOUS TO INDUCE THE PUBLICATION IN  OF AMONOGRAPH ON FRENCH BOOKPLATES BY M. POULET MALASSIS WHICH IN THE NEXTYEAR OBTAINED THE HONOURS OF A SECOND EDITION. IN ENGLAND PRIOR TO WE HAD NO WORK DEVOTED TO THE STUDY BUT IN THAT YEAR THEHONOURABLE J. LEICESTER WARRENAFTERWARDS LORD DE TABLEYPUBLISHED AGUIDE TO THE STUDY OF BOOKPLATES EX LIBRIS. HOW LITTLE WAS THENGENERALLY KNOWN ABOUT THESE MARKS OF OWNERSHIP IS SHOWN BY THE ALLUSIONSTO THEMVERY FEW IN NUMBERTHAT FIND PLACE IN THE PAGES OF SUCHPUBLICATIONS AS THE GENTLEMANS MAGAZINE OR NOTES AND QUERIES FORTHAT REASON THE SKILFUL HANDLING OF THE SUBJECT BY THE LATE LORD DETABLEY AND HIS ZEAL IN COMPILING THE TREATISE ARE ALL THE MORECONSPICUOUS.ONE OF THE MOST USEFUL WORKS WHICH HAS YET APPEARED IN THE JOURNAL OFTHE EX LIBRIS SOCIETYA SOCIETY INTENDED TO PROMOTE THE STUDY OFBOOKPLATESIS A COMPILATION BY MR. H. W. FINCHAM AND MR. J. ROBERTSBROWN A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF BOOKPLATES ARRANGED CHRONOLOGICALLY. AGLANCE AT THIS COMPILATION EMPHASISES THE TRUTH OF THE STATEMENT JUSTMADE AS TO THE SCANTINESS OF RECORDED INFORMATION ON BOOKPLATES PRIORTO THE YEAR  IT ALSO SHOWS WHAT A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THEM HAS BEENWRITTEN SINCE.WRITING TO NOTES AND QUERIES IN  DR. JACKSON HOWARD WHOSECOLLECTION IS NOW ONE OF THE LARGEST IN ENGLAND SAYS THAT HE BEGANCOLLECTING FORTY YEARS BEFORE THAT DATE AND THAT THE NUCLEUS OF HIS OWNCOLLECTION WAS ONE MADE BY A MISS JENKINS AT BATH IN . IT ISPROBABLY THEREFORE TO THIS LADY THAT WE SHOULD ATTRIBUTE THE HONOUR OFBEING THE FIRST COLLECTOR OF BOOKPLATES FOR THEIR OWN SAKE. NO DOUBTTHE COLLECTOR OF ENGRAVINGS ADMITTED INTO HIS PORTFOLIOS BOOKPLATESWORTHY A PLACE THERE AS INTERESTING ENGRAVINGS FOR STRAY EXAMPLES AREOFTEN FOUND IN SUCH COLLECTIONS AS THAT FORMED IN THE SEVENTEENTHCENTURY BY JOHN BAGFORD THE BIBLIOCLAST WHICH IS NOW IN THE BRITISHMUSEUM. NO DOUBT TOO HERALDIC PAINTERS OR PLATE ENGRAVERS COLLECTEDBOOKPLATES AS SPECIMENS OF HERALDRY BUT THIS WAS NOT COLLECTING THEMAS BOOKPLATESVIZ. AS ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE CUSTOM OF PLACING MARKS OFOWNERSHIP IN BOOKS WHICH I TAKE IT WAS EVIDENTLY MISS JENKINSSOBJECT.STILL THOUGH LITTLE WAS WRITTEN ON THE SUBJECT OF BOOKPLATES PRIOR TO IT BY NO MEANS FOLLOWS THAT FOR SOME YEARS BEFORE THAT DATE THEREHAD NOT BEEN A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF PERSONS WHO TOOK AN INTEREST INTHE SUBJECT. THE FACT IS THAT THE BOOKPLATE COLLECTOR OF EARLIER DAYSWAS WISER IN HIS GENERATION THAN ARE THOSE OF HIS KIND TODAY. HE KEPTHIS HOBBY TO HIMSELF AND WAS THUS ENABLED TO INDULGE IT ECONOMICALLY.MY FATHER HAD A SMALL COLLECTION AND I CAN WELL REMEMBER HOW AS A BOYI USED TO HELP HIM TO ADD TO IT. WE USED TO GO TO A SHOP IN A DINGYSTREET LEADING OFF OXFORD STREET AND THERE SELECT FROM A LARGECLOTHESBASKET AS MANY BOOKPLATES AS WERE NEW TO OUR COLLECTION. THEPRICE WAS ONE PENNY A PIECENEW OR OLD DATED OR UNDATED ENGLISH ORFOREIGN THAT OF BISHOP BURNET OR DAVID GARRICK OR MR. JONES OR MR.BROWNALL ALIKE A PENNY A PIECE AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THOUGH I DO NOTREMEMBER THE FACT THERE WAS THE USUAL REDUCTION ON TAKING A QUANTITY.I THINK THIS SHOP WAS ALMOST THE ONLY ONE IN LONDON WHERE YOU COULD BUYBOOKPLATES AT ALL. WELL THOSE DAYS ARE PAST NOW AND WHILST WE REGRETTHEM BECAUSE BOOKPLATE COLLECTING IS NO LONGER AN ECONOMICAL PURSUITWE CANNOT ALLOW OUR REGRET TO BE UNMINGLED WITH SATISFACTION. THEWOULDBE COLLECTOR OF TODAY CAN IF HE PLEASES KNOW SOMETHING ABOUTTHE COLLECTION HE IS UNDERTAKING HE CAN TELL WHEN HE MEETS WITH A GOODSPECIMEN HE KNOWS THE POINTS WHICH RENDER ANY PARTICULAR BOOKPLATEINTERESTING AND HE CAN AT LEAST APPROXIMATELY AFFIX A DATE TO EACHEXAMPLE HE OBTAINS.AS TO THE MORALITY OF BOOKPLATE COLLECTING I SUPPOSE SOMETHING OUGHTTO BE SAID HERE. THERE IS BUT ONE OBJECTION TO IT BUT THAT ISUNDOUBTEDLY A SERIOUS ONE TAKING A BOOKPLATE OUT OF A BOOK MEANS THEPOSSIBLE DISFIGUREMENT AND INJURY OF THE VOLUME FROM WHICH IT IS TAKENYET FOR THE PURPOSE OF STUDY AND COMPARISON THE REMOVAL IS A DISTINCTADVANTAGE. TO CONFESS THIS SEEMS AT FIRST SIGHT TO BRING COLLECTING ATALL UNDER A SWEEPING CONDEMNATION AND SUCH INDEED WOULD BE THE CASEWERE IT NOT FOR THE FACT THAT DAMAGE TO OR EVEN THE ACTUAL DESTRUCTIONOF VERY MANY BOOKS IS REALLY A MATTER OF NO CONSEQUENCE WHATEVER.BOOKPLATES ARE FOUND QUITE AS OFTEN IN THE WORTHLESS LITERARYPRODUCTIONS OF OUR ANCESTORS AS IN THE WORTHY AND IT IS PUERILE TOCAVIL OVER THE REMOVAL OF A BOOKPLATE FROM A BINDING WHICH HOLDSTOGETHER MATERIAL BY THE DESTRUCTION OF WHICH THE WORLD WOULD CERTAINLYNOT BE THE POORER. SO MUCH FOR THE BOOKPLATES IN VALUELESS BOOKS. ASREGARDS THOSE IN VALUABLE OR INTERESTING ONES IT IS CERTAINLY UNWISE TOREMOVE THEM AT ALL. THIS IS A GOLDEN RULE WHICH CANNOT BE TOO FORCIBLYIMPRESSED UPON COLLECTORS AND BOOKSELLERS. THE CASE DOES NOT OCCUR VERYOFTEN AND WHEN IT DOES THE BOOK ITSELF WITH THE BOOKPLATE IN IT CANBE EASILY FETCHED AND PLACED BESIDE THE COLLECTION WHEN NEEDED FORCOMPARISON. IT MAY HAPPEN THAT THE BOOKPLATE IN THIS VALUABLE BOOK ISINTERESTING FROM THE FACT THAT IT BELONGED TO SOME MAN OF NOTE OR THATIT IS UNIQUE IF SO WE HAVE ONLY A FURTHER REASON AGAINST TAKING IT OUTOF THE VOLUME. THE VALUE OF A VERY EARLY BOOKPLATE WHEN PRESERVED INTHE VOLUME IN WHICH IT IS DISCOVERED IS LESSENED ALMOST TO A VANISHINGPOINT IF SEPARATED FROM THAT VOLUME. PASTED INTO A BOOK AS A MARK OFOWNERSHIP IT IS AN UNDOUBTED BOOKPLATE WHEREAS IF TAKEN OUT ANDFASTENED INTO A COLLECTION OF BOOKPLATES IT AT ONCE LOSES THE PROOF OFITS ORIGINAL USE SO ESSENTIAL TO ITS VALUE AND SO MATERIAL TO THESTUDENT OF BOOKPLATES.ON THE OTHER HAND AS I HAVE SAID THERE IS NO HARM IN REMOVING FROMSOME UNINTERESTING AND VALUELESS VOLUME THE BOOKPLATE OF A FAMOUS MAN.EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT BISHOP BURNET OR DAVID GARRICK HAD PLENTY OF WHATTHEY THEMSELVES REGARDED AS RUBBISH IN THEIR LIBRARIES SO THATBURNETS BOOKPLATE IN AN ACTUALLY VALUELESS VOLUME DOES NOT PROVE THATTHE BISHOPS SHREWD EYE EVER SCANNED ITS PAGES OR THAT HIS EPISCOPALHAND EVER HELD IT. BESIDES I KNOW AS A FACT THAT IT IS A NOT UNCOMMONTRICK FOR THE POSSESSOR OF THE BOOKPLATE OF SOME FAMOUS MAN TO AFFIXTHAT BOOKPLATE IN A WORTHLESS VOLUME AND THEN OFFER THE WHOLE FOR SALEAT A PRICE MUCH HIGHER THAN WOULD BE ASKED OR OBTAINED FOR THEBOOKPLATE ITSELF THOUGH THE VALUE OF THE BOOK MAY BE NILWITHOUT QUARRELLING WITH THE NAME BOOKPLATEAS APPLIED TO THE MARKSOF OWNERSHIP PASTED INTO BOOKSAND WITHOUT WASTING TIME WITHDISCUSSION OF SUGGESTIONS FOR A BETTER ONE IT MAY BE ADMITTED THAT THEWORD IS NOT ALTOGETHER HAPPILY CHOSEN. IT PERHAPS SUGGESTS TO THE MINDOF THE UNINITIATED AN ILLUSTRATION IN A BOOK RATHER THAN A MARK OFPOSSESSION. BUT THEN AT THE PRESENT DAY THERE ARE NOT MANY UNINITIATEDAMONGST EITHER BUYERS OR SELLERS OF BOOKS AND PRINTS SO THAT THEINAPPROPRIATENESS OF THE NAME NEED NOT CONCERN US.AS TO ITS ANTIQUITY THAT IS DOUBTFUL BUT PROBABLY ONE OF THE EARLIESTINSTANCES OF ITS USE IN PRINT OCCURS IN  WHEN JOHN IRELANDPUBLISHED THE FIRST TWO VOLUMES OF HIS HOGARTH ILLUSTRATED. IN THISWORK HE SAYS THAT THE WORKS OF CALLOT WERE PROBABLY HOGARTHS FIRSTMODELS AND SHOP BILLS AND BOOKPLATES HIS FIRST PERFORMANCES.AGAIN IN  IRELAND REFERS TO THE BOOKPLATE FOR LAMBERT THEHERALDPAINTER WHICH HOGARTH HAD EXECUTED. IN  A CERTAIN C. S.B. WRITING IN THE PAGES OF THE GENTLEMANS MAGAZINE REFERS TO WHATARE GENERALLY CALLED BOOKPLATES. HIS LETTER WAS SUGGESTED BY ANARTICLEA REVIEW OF THOMAS MOULES BIBLIOTHECA HERALDICAIN THEPREVIOUS NUMBER OF THE MAGAZINE THE WRITER OF WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY NOTFAMILIAR WITH THE TERM BOOKPLATE AS WE NOW APPLY IT FOR HE CALLSBOOKPLATES PLATES OF ARMS. WE SHALL SEE LATER ON THAT THIS IS QUITEAN INAPPROPRIATE NAME SOME OF THE MOST INTERESTING AND THE MOSTBEAUTIFUL BOOKPLATES HAVE NOTHING ARMORIAL ABOUT THEM.ON THE CONTINENT THE TERM EX LIBRIS IS GENERALLY APPLIED TOBOOKPLATES. THIS IS PERHAPS EVEN LESS APPROPRIATE THAN BOOKPLATE. ITIS TAKEN FROM THE TWO FIRST WORDS OF THE INSCRIPTION ON A GREAT MANYBOOKPLATES WHEN THE INSCRIPTION IS WRITTEN IN LATINE.G. EX LIBRISJOHANNIS STEARNE S.T.P. EPISCOPI CLOGHERENSIS. A MOMENTS REFLECTIONWILL SHOW THAT THIS INSCRIPTION IS NOT INTENDED AS A DECLARATION BY THEBOOKPLATE SHOULD IT EVER BECOME SEVERED FROM THE BOOK IN WHICH IT WASFASTENED THAT IT CAME OUT OF A BOOK BELONGING TO BISHOP STEARNE BUTTHAT IT IS A DECLARATION BY THE BOOK IN WHICH THE BOOKPLATE IS FOUNDPASTED THAT THAT PARTICULAR BOOK IS FROM AMONGST THE BOOKS OF APARTICULAR LIBRARY AND OUGHT TO BE RESTORED TO IT. IT WOULD BE ASRATIONAL TO CALL BOOKPLATES LIBRI BECAUSE THE INSCRIPTION ON THEMOFTEN BEGINSAS IN A VERY FAMOUS GERMAN BOOKPLATELIBER BILIBALDIPIRCKHEIMER. IT MAY INDEED BE LAID DOWN AS A GENERAL RULE THATWHATEVER THE SENTIMENT EXPRESSED ON A BOOKPLATE IT IS CLEARLY INTENDEDTO BE UTTERED BY THE BOOK IN WHICH THE BOOKPLATE IS FIXED NOT BY THEBOOKPLATE ITSELF.THERE ARE BUT TWO INSTANCES QUOTED BY LORD DE TABLEY OF THEINSCRIPTION DIRECTLY REFERRING TO THE BOOKPLATE. BOTH ARE FOREIGNAND DATE ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY. ONE IS SYMBOLUMBIBLIOTHEC OF JOHN BERNARD NACK A CITIZEN AND MERCHANT OFFRANKFORT AND THE OTHER INSIGNE LIBRORUM ETC. QUOTED FROM THEWORK OF M. POULET MALASSIS. LORD DE TABLEY THINKS THAT THE SYMBOLUM OFHERR NACK IS SIMPLY A TRADE CARD BUT HE FOUNDS THIS CONCLUSION ON THESUPPOSITION THAT HERR NACK WAS A BOOKDEALER AND THAT THE SCENEDEPICTED ON HIS BOOKPLATE WAS IN FACT HIS SHOP. IN MY OPINION WEHAVE IN THIS BOOKPLATE A REPRESENTATION OF A PORTION OF HERR NACKSLIBRARY IN WHICH MINERVA IS SEATED USING THE BOOKS THEREOF. AGENTLEMAN IN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY DRESS WHO MAY LIKELY ENOUGH BE HERRNACK HIMSELF ADDRESSES HIMSELF TO THE GODDESS AND EXPLAINSAS HEPOINTS TO THE OUTER SCENE WHICH SHOWS US SHIPS AND MERCHANDISETHATWHILST FOLLOWING HIS TRADE AS A MERCHANT HE STILL HAS TIME TO DEVOTESOME ATTENTION TO LITERATURE. IN ANY CASE THESE AND THE FEW OTHERINSTANCES THERE MAY BE OF THE INSCRIPTION REFERRING TO THE BOOKPLATEAND NOT TO THE BOOK SEEM HARDLY SUFFICIENT TO MAKE EX LIBRIS A GOODNAME FOR BOOKPLATES IN GENERAL.OUR ANCESTORS OF DEGREES MORE REMOTE THAN GRANDFATHER DO NOT APPEAR TOHAVE REFERRED TO BOOKPLATES AT ALL SO WE ARE UNABLE TO LEARN BY WHATNAME THEY WOULD HAVE CALLED THEM. PEPYS IN  SPEAKS OF GOING TO HISPLATEMAKERS AND THERE SPENDING AN HOUR ABOUT CONTRIVING HISLITTLE PLATE FOR HIS BOOKS. THIS LITTLE PLATE STILL EXISTS AND IS ACHARACTERISTIC ONE IT SHOWS US THE INITIALS S. P. WITH TWO ANCHORSAND ROPES ENTWINED. BUT WE SHALL SPEAK AGAIN OF THIS AND SAMS OTHERBOOKPLATES LATER ON.ILLUSTRATION SIR THOMAS ISHAMS BOOKPLATE BY DAVID LOGGAN.DAVID LOGGAN A GERMAN BORN AND AN ENGRAVER OF SOME NOTE HAS INWRITING TO SIR THOMAS ISHAM IN  A NO MORE CONCISE NAME FOR ISHAMSBOOKPLATE THAN A PRINT OF YOUR COTE OF ARMS. LOGGAN AS A RETURN FORMANY FAVOURS HAD SENT SIR THOMAS A BOOKPLATE DESIGNED AND EXECUTEDBY HIMSELF. SIR HE SAYS IN THE COVERING LETTER I SEND YOU HIER APRINT OF YOUR COTE OF ARMES. I HAVE PRINTED  WICH I WILL SEND WITHTHE PLATE BY THE NEXT RETURN AND BEGE THE FAVOR OF YOUR KEINDEXCEPTTANS OF IT AS A SMALL NIEW YAERS GIFT OR A AKNOWLEDGMENT IN PARTFOR ALL YOUR FAVORS. IF ANYTHING IN IT BE AMIES I SHALL BE GLADE TOMEND IT. I HAVE TAKEN THE HERALDS PAINTERS DERECTION IN IT IT IS VERYMUCH USED AMONGST PERSONS OF QUALITY TO PAST THER COTES OF ARMES BEFORTHER BOOKES INSTADE OF WREITHING THER NAMES.THE HERALDS PAINTER WAS UNFORTUNATELY WRONG IN HIS TREATMENT OF THEISHAM COAT AND SO LOGGANS WORK ARTISTIC AS IT MIGHT BE COULD NOTBE ACCEPTABLE TO SIR THOMAS TO WHOM A MISTAKE IN THE FAMILY ESCUTCHEONWAS NO LIGHT MATTER. THIS HE EVIDENTLY TOLD DAVID WHO A FEW DAYSAFTER WRITES TO HIM AGAINI AME SORRY THAT THE COTE IS WRONGE I HAVE TAKEN THE HERALDSDERECTION IN IT BUT THE FOOLE DID GIVE IT WRONG. . . . THE ALTERING OFTHE PLATE WILL BE VERY TRUBELSOM AND THERFOR YOU WILL BE PRESENTED WITHA NEWE ONE WICH SHALL BE DON WITHOUT FALT AND THAT VERY SUDENLY. ANDIF YOU PLASE SIR TO GIVE THIES PLATE AND THE PRINTS TO YOUR BROTHERSIT WILL SERVE FOR THEM.THESE ISHAM BOOKPLATES ARE REALLY VERY BEAUTIFUL PIECES OF WORK. AREPRODUCTION OF ONE OF THEM MAY BE SEEN ON THE FOREGOING PAGE. THIS ISEVIDENTLY THE ONE FIRST EXECUTED THE OMISSION OF THE MARK OFBARONETCYTHE BLOODY HAND OF ULSTERAND THE HELMET OF AN ESQUIREINSTEAD OF A KNIGHT OR BARONET CLEARLY CONSTITUTING THE BLUNDER INTOWHICH LOGGAN HAD FALLEN. BY THE KINDNESS OF SIR CHARLES ISHAM THEPRESENT BARONET I HAVE BEEN ENABLED TO SEE A COPY OF THE CORRECTEDDESIGN SENT BY LOGGAN WHICH IS IN ALL RESPECTS ACCURATE. THIS WAS DOINGDUTY AS A BOOKPLATE IN A VOLUME IN WHICH IT HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN PLACEDAT THE TIME IT WAS RECEIVED BY SIR THOMAS.NICHOLAS CAREW AFTERWARDS SIR NICHOLAS CAREW BARONET RECORDS IN HISACCOUNTS ON THE TH FEBRUARY  A PAYMENT FOR HIS BOOKPLATE WHICHIS DATED IN THAT YEAR AS FOLLOWSFOR COAT OF ARMS IMPRESSING L.S. D. AND A FEW MONTHS LATER IS A PAYMENT FOR  ARMES S.D.THE MARK OF MY BOOKS IS THE PHRASE WHICH ANDREW LUMISDEN APPLIES TOTHE BOOKPLATE ENGRAVED FOR HIM BY HIS BROTHERINLAW SIR ROBERTSTRANGE ABOUT THE YEAR . THE PLATE IS AN INTERESTING ONE AND BY ANINTERESTING MAN OF WHOM WE SHALL SPEAK LATER ON. LUMISDEN THOUGHT WELLOF IT AND THUS REFERS TO THE WORK IN A LETTER WRITTEN FROM ROUEN INJUNE I AM VERY ANXIOUS TO KNOW IF MY BROTHER CONTINUES HISRESOLUTION OF COMING TO THIS COUNTRY. IF HE DOES I CAN LUCKILY BE OFUSE TO HIM IN THE WAY OF HIS BUSINESS FROM THE ACQUAINTANCE I HAVE OF AVERY INGENIOUS PERSON PROFESSOR OF THE ACADEMY OF DESIGN HERE . . . ISHOWD HIM A FEW DAYS AGO THE MARK OF MY BOOKS FROM WHICH HEENTERTAINS A HIGH NOTION OF ROBIES ABILITIES.THERE IS A CURIOUS ADVERTISEMENT QUOTED BY THOMAS MOULE IN HISBIBLIOTHECA HERALDICA OF A CERTAIN JOSEPH BARBER A NEWCASTLEONTYNEBOOKSELLER MUSIC AND COPPERPLATE PUBLISHER WHO IN  RESIDED INHUMBLES BUILDINGS. IN THAT YEAR HE ENGRAVED THE EQUESTRIAN STATUE OFKING JAMES II. WHICH ONCE STOOD IN THE SANDHILL MARKET. IF AMOMENTS DIGRESSION BE ALLOWED THE HISTORY OF THIS STATUE IS WORTHTELLING. ON TH MARCH  THE TOWN COUNCIL VOTED  FOR THEERECTION OF A FIGURE OF HIS MAJESTY IN A ROMAN HABIT ON A CAPERINGHORSE IN COPPER AS BIG AS THE FIGURE OF HIS MAJESTY KING CHARLES I.AT CHARING CROSSE ON A PEDESTAL OF BLACK MARBLE. A CERTAIN MR. WILLIAMLARSON EXECUTED IT SIR CHRISTOPHER WREN EXPRESSED HIS APPROVAL ANDEVERYBODY WAS VERY PLEASED FOR A YEAR OR TWO. BUT POPULAR FEELING SOONCHANGED IN NEWCASTLE AS ELSEWHERE AND THE PREVALENCE OF SENTIMENTSWHICH THREW THE KING OFF HIS THRONE THREW HIS METAL REPRESENTATION INTOTHE TYNE WHERE IT RESTED TILL FISHED OUT TO BE MELTED DOWN AND USED TOMAKE A SET OF CHURCH BELLS. THE DRAWING OF THE LUCKLESS STATUE WAS SAFEIN THE KEEPING OF SIR HANS SLOANE AND FROM THIS BARBER MADE HISENGRAVING WHICH HE SOLD FOR S. THE FACT THAT IN  THREE YEARSBEFORE THE SECOND SCOTCH REBELLION THIS NEWCASTLE PRINTSELLER FOUND ITWORTH WHILE TO ISSUE THE ENGRAVING AT ALL IS NOT WITHOUT POLITICALSIGNIFICANCE. WITH HIS ENGRAVING BARBER ISSUED TWO LARGE PLATES OF THEARMS OF ALL THE SUBSCRIBERS TO IT EACH COAT OF ARMS BEING  INCHESIN LENGTH AND  INCHES IN BREADTH AND A FEW YEARS LATER IT SEEMSTO HAVE OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE MIGHT TURN AN HONEST PENNY BY CUTTING UPTHESE LARGE SHEETS OF THE SUBSCRIBERS ARMS SO THAT EACH COAT OF ARMSBECAME A SEPARATE PLATE. HAVING DONE THIS HE ISSUED AN ADVERTISEMENT TOTHE SUBSCRIBERS IN WHICH HE SETS FORTH THAT HE IS THE SOLE PROPRIETOROF EACH OF THEIR PLATES AND IS WILLING TO PART WITH IT TO THE LADY ORGENTLEMAN WHOSE ARMS ARE ENGRAVED THEREON TOGETHER WITH ONE HUNDREDPRINTS OF IT ON A GOOD PAPER FOR THE MODEST SUM OF HALFACROWN. THESEPLATES SUGGESTS MR. BARBER MIGHT BE ADVANTAGEOUSLY USED AS WHAT WE NOWCALL BOOKPLATES AND HE CONTINUES THE DESIGN OF THIS PROPOSAL IS AUSEFUL AND NECESSARY EMBELLISHMENT AND A REMEDY AGAINST LOSING BOOKS BYLENDING OR HAVING THEM STOLEN BY PASTING ONE PRINT ON THE INSIDE OFTHE COVER OF EACH BOOK YOU HAVE THE OWNERS NAME COAT OF ARMS ANDPLACE OF ABODE A THING SO USEFUL AND THE CHARGE SO EASY TIS HOPEDWILL MEET WITH ENCOURAGEMENT. TO HAVE A PLATE ENGRAVED WILL COST S.D.FROM ALL WHICH IT MAY BE INFERRED THAT MR. JOSEPH BARBER THOUGHTORWANTED OTHER PEOPLE TO THINKTHAT THE IDEA OF USING A BOOKPLATE WASHIS OWN. NEWCASTLE PEOPLE IN  MUST HAVE BEEN VERY UNOBSERVANT OFTHE HABITS OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS IF THEY BELIEVED MR. BARBER FOR THEFASHION OF USING A BOOKPLATEWHICH IN ENGLAND CAME IN SOME FORTY YEARSBEFOREWAS BY THAT TIME GENERAL THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. THAT SOME OFTHE SUBSCRIBERS ACCEPTED THE OFFER AND GOT THEIR HUNDRED PLATES ON AGOOD PAPER FOR HALFACROWN IS DEMONSTRATED BY THE EXISTENCE OF COPIESOF THE PLATES PUBLISHED WITH THE EQUESTRIAN STATUE BEING STILL FOUNDIN BOOKS DOING DUTY AS BOOKPLATES. VERY POOR PRODUCTIONS THEY AREREFLECTING BUT SLIGHT CREDIT ON THE DESIGNER OR ENGRAVER. BUT WHATJOSEPH LACKED IN ART HE ATONED FOR IN ENTERPRISE WE SEE THIS IN HISINGENIOUS WAY OF GETTING RID OF HIS OLD COPPERPLATES AND THEPOSTSCRIPT TO HIS ADVERTISEMENT DEMONSTRATES THE FACT EVEN MORE PLAINLYFOR ON A DAY NEAR AT HAND THE ADVERTISEMENT TELLS US WAS TO BE FOUGHTAT A NEIGHBOURING COCKPIT A WELSH MAIN AND THE PRIZE WAS TO BENOTHING LESS THAN ONE OF THE ADVERTISERS ENGRAVINGS A PRETTY PIECE OFWORK WORTHY THE OBSERVATION OF THE CURIOUS. IF THE TERM BOOKPLATE HADBEEN KNOWN IN BARBERS DAY IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE FOUND ITS WAY INTOHIS ADVERTISEMENT WHICH IS CLUMSY FROM THE WANT OF A WORD TO EXPRESSTHE VERY THING HE IS ADVERTISING.WILLIAM STEPHENS WHO ENGRAVED A GOOD MANY BOOKPLATES IN HIS TIMECOULD FIND NO BETTER EXPRESSION THAN PRINT OF YOUR ARMS TO DESCRIBETHE  BOOKPLATES WHICH FOR HALFAGUINEA HE SENT TO DR. SAMUELKERRICH THE SHAKESPEARIAN STUDENT IN .HORACE WALPOLE AGAIN WOULD I THINK HAVE USED THE PHRASE BOOKPLATEHAD HE KNOWN IT. IN HIS CATALOGUE OF ENGRAVERSTHE EDITION OFHE SPEAKS OF GEORGE VERTUE HAVING ENGRAVED A PLATE TO PUT IN LADYOXFORDS BOOKS AND IN HIS ANECDOTES OF PAINTING HE REFERS TO THEPLATE WHICH HOGARTH USED FOR HIS BOOKS. ONE OF HIS OWNBOOKPLATESTHAT ENGRAVED SOON AFTER WALPOLE DESCRIBES AS HISSEAL SIGILLUM HORATII COMITIS DE ORFORD BUT THIS PHRASE IS ITHINK USED SIMPLY BECAUSE THE BOOKPLATE ITSELF IS THE REPRESENTATIONOF A MEDIVAL SEAL. BARTOLOZZIGIVING IN  A RECEIPT FOR ABOOKPLATE WHICH HE HAD JUST COMPLETEDREFERS TO IT AS A TICKETPLATESEE P.  BUT HE WAS A FOREIGNER AND MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN THE ENGLISHNAME FOR SUCH THINGS FOR WE HAVE SEEN THAT SOME FIVE YEARS BEFOREIRELAND REFERS TO HOGARTHS BOOKPLATE. CHARLES JAMES FOX IN A NOTEDATED AT LEICESTER ON ND AUGUST  SPEAKS OF THE BOOKPLATE OF HISGREATGREATGRANDFATHER SIR STEPHEN FOX.BUT THOUGH THE PHRASE BOOKPLATE MAY HAVE BEEN OCCASIONALLY USED ATTHE CLOSE OF THE LAST CENTURY AND THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESENT IT WASTHEN BY NO MEANS WIDELY USED AND ALTHOUGH THE WRITER QUOTED ON PAGE REFERS IN  TO WHAT ARE GENERALLY CALLED BOOKPLATES WILLIAM WADDIN  CAN FIND NO DIRECT TERM BY WHICH TO REFER TO THESE MARKS OFOWNERSHIP. SPEAKING IN MEMS. MAXIMS AND MEMOIRS HE SAYS IN THELIBRARY OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS THERE ARE MANY VOLUMESFORMERLY THE PROPERTY OF THE CELEBRATED DOUGLAS HAVING HIS ARMSEMBELLISHED WITH VARIOUS KINDS OF SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS WHICH WAS BY NOMEANS AN UNCOMMON PRACTICE AS IN THE LIBRARY OF THE COLLEGE OFPHYSICIANS THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES OF VOLUMES WHERE THE FORMER POSSESSORHAS NOT ONLY BLAZONED HIS OWN ARMS BUT BORROWED THE ARMS OF THECOLLEGE AND SUPERADDED SUPPORTERS AS APOLLO MERCURY SCULAPIUS ANDHIS DAUGHTER HYGEIA.LORD BYRON TOO DID NOT I FANCY KNOW THE WORD BOOKPLATE IN ITSNOWUSED SENSE WRITING TO A FAIR ADMIRER WHO HAD APPARENTLY DESIGNEDONE OF THESE FOR HIM HE SAYS I RECEIVED THE ARMS MY DEAR MISS AND AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR THE TROUBLE YOU HAVE TAKEN. IT ISIMPOSSIBLE I SHOULD HAVE ANY FAULT TO FIND WITH THEM. THE SIGHT OF THEDRAWING GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE FOR A DOUBLE REASON IN THE FIRST PLACETHEY WILL ORNAMENT MY BOOKS AND IN THE NEXT THEY CONVINCE ME THAT YOUHAVE NOT ENTIRELY FORGOT ME.SO THE TERM BOOKPLATE IS ONLY A CENTURY OLD AND THE FASHION OFCOLLECTING BOOKPLATES MUCH MORE MODERN STILL BUT THE USE OFBOOKPLATES IS REALLY OF RESPECTABLE ANTIQUITY AND IS A MATTER ON WHICHWE MAY NOW APPROPRIATELY SPEAK. WHETHER IN THE FIRST INSTANCE THE USEOF BOOKPLATES WAS SUGGESTED BY A DESIRE TO COMMEMORATE A GIFT OR AS AMARK OF OWNERSHIP SEEMS TO BE A MATTER ON WHICH A VARIETY OF OPINIONSEXIST. SOME OF THE EARLIEST MECHANICALLY PRODUCED BOOKPLATES ARECERTAINLY COMMEMORATIVE OF GIFTS SEE P.  BUT I THINK WE MUSTACCEPT AS BOOKPLATES TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES THE SIX FOURTEENTHCENTURY EXAMPLES MENTIONED BY HERR WARNECKE IN HIS DIE DEUTSCHENBCHERZEICHEN AN EXCELLENT WORK ON GERMAN BOOKPLATES. THESE AREHERALDIC COLOURED DRAWINGS ON THE PARCHMENT LEAVES OF ITALIANMANUSCRIPTS WHICH ALSO BEAR AN INSCRIPTION OF POSSESSION BY THEPARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS WHOSE ARMS ARE REPRESENTED.BUT OF COURSE THE REAL NECESSITY FOR BOOKPLATES WHATEVER MAY HAVEBEEN THEIR ORIGINAL USE BEGAN WHEN THE PRINTINGPRESS GAVE TO THE WORLDNOT TWO NOR THREE BUT A HUNDRED OR MORE COPIES OF A PARTICULAR BOOK.THEN IT WAS THAT THE DIFFERENT OWNERS NEEDED TO DISTINGUISH THEIRRESPECTIVE COPIES OF A WORK FOR THE PROFESSIONAL BOOKBORROWER WHOWOULD GLADLY HAVE RETAINED THE MANUSCRIPT VOLUME LENT TO HIM BY ANUNSUSPECTING FRIEND COULD HE HAVE DONE SO WITHOUT HIS CRIME BEINGDETECTED DOUBTLESS SAW IN THE MULTITUDE OF COPIES A GREATER OPPORTUNITYOF CARRYING OUT HIS NEFARIOUS DESIGNS. THE EXISTENCE OF BOOKPLATES ISTHEREFORE LARGELY DUE TO THE LITERARY ENTHUSIAST WHO AMASSES A LIBRARYBY RETAINING VOLUMES RECEIVED ON LOAN THE INSCRIPTIONS ON SOME OF THEEARLIER BOOKPLATES PROVE THIS TO BE SO.THE EARLIEST PRINTED BOOKPLATES ARE CERTAINLY GERMAN AND THERE ISLITTLE DOUBT THAT SOME OF THESE ARE NEARLY CONTEMPORARY WITH THE VERYEARLY PRINTED BOOKS ON THE OAK COVERS OF WHICH THEY MAY STILL BE FOUNDPASTED. BY THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY BOOKPLATES WEREFREQUENTLY FINE EXAMPLES OF THE WOODENGRAVERS ART. ALBERT DRERHIMSELF DESIGNED BOOKPLATES AND OF THESE ONE OF THE MOST ELABORATEAND THE BEST KNOWN IS THAT OF HIS FRIEND BILIBALD PIRCKHEIMER THENUREMBERG JURIST WHOSE PORTRAIT HE ENGRAVED ON COPPER IN . THEBOOKPLATE IS STILL EARLIER.ENGLAND CAN NOWTHANKS TO RECENT INVESTIGATIONSCLAIM THE SECOND PLACEIN THE CHRONOLOGICAL SEQUENCE OF COUNTRIES IN WHICH BOOKPLATES HAVEBEEN USED. CARDINAL WOLSEYS BOOKPLATE SEE P.  IS PROBABLY NOTLATER IN DATE THAN . FRANCE CAN BOAST OF A BOOKPLATE DATED IN SWEDEN OF ONE DATED IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND SWITZERLAND OF ONE IN ITALY IN  IN OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES DATED EXAMPLES DO NOTAPPEAR NOR DOES THE PRACTICE OF USING BOOKPLATES SEEM TO HAVE BEENADOPTED UNTIL CONSIDERABLY LATER.IN CONCLUDING THIS OPENING CHAPTER LET ME SAY A WORD ABOUT THE POSITIONIN A BOOK IN WHICH A BOOKPLATE SHOULD BE LOOKED FOR. THE USUAL PLACEWAS CERTAINLY ON THE FRONT COVER OF A VOLUME SOMETIMES ANOTHER COPY OFTHE SAME PLATE WAS FASTENED TO THE BACK COVER AND SOMETIMESAS INPIRCKHEIMERS CASE JUST NOTICED AND IN THAT OF SAMUEL PEPYS SEE P.THE SAME PERSON WOULD USE A DIFFERENT BOOKPLATE AT THE BACK OFTHE VOLUME TO THAT USED AT THE FRONT. ANOTHER PLAN LESS FREQUENT BUTBY NO MEANS UNCOMMON WAS TO INSERT THE BOOKPLATE ON THE TITLEPAGEOFTEN ON THE BACK OF IT AND ANOTHER TO FASTEN THE BOOKPLATE INTO THEVOLUME BY PASTING ITS RIGHTHAND MARGIN ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN INCH ONTO THE TITLEPAGE SO THAT THE BOOKPLATE WOULD FOLD OVER AND FACE IT.THIS IS A PLAN THAT LEADS TO A BOOKPLATE BEING MOST EASILY OVERLOOKED.COLLECTORS SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT IN MANY INSTANCES BOOKPLATES AREFOUND IN A VARIETY OF SIZES THIS SHOULD CERTAINLY BE BORNE IN MINDWHEN SETTING ASIDE ANY PARTICULAR SPECIMEN AS A DUPLICATE. IN THEPRESENT DAY MOST PEOPLE ARE CONTENT TO HAVE A BOOKPLATE SMALL ENOUGHTO GO INTO A VOLUME OF ANY SIZE ITS DWARFED APPEARANCE ON THE COVER OFA FULLSIZED FOLIO IS NO EYESORE TO THEM OR IF IT IS THE PLEASURE OFECONOMY MAKES THEM BEAR WITH IT. BUT IN DAYS GONE BY IT WASESPECIALLYIN GERMANYCERTAINLY OTHERWISE. THE POSSESSION OF A LARGE LIBRARY WOULDNECESSITATE IN THE OWNERS MIND THE POSSESSION OF A NUMBER OFDIFFERENTLY SIZED BOOKPLATES IN ORDER TO GET ONE WHICH WOULD NEITHERLOOK TOO SMALL IN THE LARGEST VOLUME NOR BE TOO LARGE FOR THE SMALLESTSOME OF THE MOST NOBLE FOREIGN EXAMPLES RICH IN DETAIL AND BOLD INGENERAL EFFECT ARE THOSE THAT BELONGED TO MEN WHO LIKED TO HAVE FORTHEIR FOLIOS A BOOKPLATE OF PROPORTIONATE SIZE. THERE ARE NO VERY LARGEENGLISH BOOKPLATES BUT PLENTY OF LIBRARY OWNERS IN THIS COUNTRY HADTWO OR THREE DIFFERENT SIZED BOOKPLATES AND THE LATE SIR WILLIAMSTIRLINGMAXWELL BOASTED OF OVER A HUNDRED VARIETIESFOOTNOTES AMONG THE LATE SIR BERNARD BURKES PAPERS THERE WAS DISCOVERED ACOLLECTION OF BOOKPLATES SAID TO HAVE BEEN FORMED IN IRELAND IN THEMIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY BUT THERE IS NOTHING TO SHOW THAT THECOLLECTION WAS FORMED AS A COLLECTION OF BOOKPLATES QUA BOOKPLATES. THERE ARE TWO VARIETIES OF THIS BOOKPLATE. MOORE VOL. I. P. .CHAPTER IITHE EARLY USE OF BOOKPLATES IN ENGLANDIN A SHORT PAPER WHICH IN  I CONTRIBUTED TO THE ANTIQUARIANMAGAZINE AND BIBLIOGRAPHER I WROTE THIS PASSAGEIT IS DIFFICULT TOBELIEVE THAT THE GENERAL USE OF BOOKPLATES SHOULD HAVE BEEN A HUNDREDAND FIFTY YEARS IN REACHING THIS COUNTRY FROM THE CONTINENT AND YETTHERE IS RATHER MORE DIFFERENCE THAN THAT BETWEEN THE DATE ON THEEARLIESTKNOWN GERMAN EXAMPLE  AND THE TIME WHEN ENGLISHDATEDSPECIMENS APPEAR AT ALL PLENTIFULLY. SURELY THE MANY ENGLISH MEN OFLETTERS WHO AMASSED LARGE LIBRARIES IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY AND THEFIRST HALF OF THE SEVENTEENTH MUST HAVE POSSESSED BOOKPLATES AND YETWHERE ARE THEIR BOOKPLATES NOWMANY NO DOUBT HAVE PERISHED WITH THE BINDINGS TO WHICH THEY WEREFASTENED BUT SOME ARE DOUBTLESS STILL EXTANT AND WE MAY YET HOPE THATWHEN THE INTEREST IN THESE LABELS BECOMES MORE WIDELY DIFFUSED MORETHAN ONE OR TWO SPECIMENS WILL BE BROUGHT TO LIGHT BEARING AN ENGRAVEDDATE SUFFICIENTLY EARLY TO DISPEL THE IDEA THAT THIS COUNTRY WAS ACENTURY AND A HALF BEHIND ITS GERMAN NEIGHBOURS IN THE GENERAL PRACTICEOF USING BOOKPLATES.MR. DANIEL PARSONS WHO MAY BE PROPERLY CALLED THE FATHER OF BOOKPLATELITERATUREHIS CONTRIBUTION IN  TO THE THIRD ANNUAL REPORT OFTHE OXFORD UNIVERSITY ARCHOLOGICAL AND HERALDIC SOCIETY WAS CERTAINLYTHE FIRST PAPER ON THE SUBJECT THAT EVER APPEAREDCOMMENTED ON THISHOPE OF MINE IN THE NUMBER OF THE SAME MAGAZINE ISSUED IN THE FOLLOWINGJANUARY AND WAS DESPONDENT AS TO EVIDENCE BEING FORTHCOMING TO PROVETHE EARLY USE OF BOOKPLATES IN ENGLAND.WELL IN THAT I EXPRESSED THE BELIEF THAT INVESTIGATION WOULD BRING TOLIGHT A NUMBER OF SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURY DATED BOOKPLATESI WAS PERHAPS WRONGEARLY ENGLISH DATED BOOKPLATES HAVE NOT BEEN FOUNDIN ANYTHING APPROACHING PLENTY BUT I WAS ALSO WRONG IN SUGGESTING THATPROOF OF THE EARLY USE OF BOOKPLATES IN THIS COUNTRY COULD ONLY BEPROVED BY DATED EXAMPLES THE EXISTENCE OF EXAMPLES WHICH FROM INTERNALEVIDENCE ARE PROVED TO BE OF EARLY DATE IS REALLY EQUALLY VALUABLE ANDAS THESE HAVE CERTAINLY COME TO LIGHT IN CONSIDERABLE NUMBERS I THINK AGOOD CASE HAS BEEN MADE OUT ON BEHALF OF OUR FELLOWCOUNTRYMEN.I DO NOT PRETEND THAT EARLY ENGLISH BOOKPLATES ARE SO PLENTIFUL ASTHOSE OF GERMANY. SOME INDIVIDUAL SPECIMENS ARE KNOWN TO EXIST BUTTHERE ARE VERY FEW THAT ARE RECORDED AS EXISTING IN MORE THAN A FEWCOLLECTIONS AND SOME ARE UNIQUE. FROM SOME CAUSE OR OTHER EARLYENGLISH BOOKPLATES ARE A RARITY AND I PROPOSE THEREFORE TO SPEAKINDIVIDUALLY OF THE MAJORITY OF THEMTHAT IS TO SAY OF THOSEEXECUTED PRIOR TO THE CLOSE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.BUT BEFORE DOING THIS LET ME SAY A WORD AS TO THE DATE AT WHICH THECOLOURS INTENDED TO BE SHOWN ON THE SHIELD OF ARMS WERE FIRSTREPRESENTED BY LINES OR POINTS. FOR INSTANCE PERPENDICULAR LINES FROMTHE TOP TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SHIELD THUSILLUSTRATIONTO EXPRESS GULESRED.A NUMBER OF SMALL DOTS OR POINTS THUSILLUSTRATIONTO EXPRESS ORGOLD AND SO ON.TO WHOM MAY BE ATTACHED THE CREDIT OF INVENTING THIS USEFUL SYSTEMMATTERS LITTLE WHAT WE ARE NOW INTERESTED INFOR THE PURPOSE OFCONSIDERING THE APPROXIMATE DATES OF BOOKPLATESIS THE TIME AT WHICHIT WAS FIRST EMPLOYED IN HERALDIC ENGRAVINGS. MR. WALTER HAMILTON INTHE PAGES OF THE EX LIBRIS JOURNAL REALISES THE IMPORTANCE OF THESUBJECT. HE SPEAKS OF THE WORK BY FATHER SILVESTER PETRASANCTAPUBLISHED AT ROME IN  IN WHICH THE PROPOSAL IS ADVOCATED ANDREFERS TO M. HENRI BOUCHOTS ALLUSION TO A WORK BY VULSSON DE LACOLOMBIRE WRITTEN IN  WHICH ADVOCATES THE SYSTEM.THAT AT AN EARLIER DATE LINES RUNNING ALL IN ONE DIRECTION WERE USEDONLY AS SHADING IS SHOWN OVER AND OVER AGAIN. TAKE FOR INSTANCE THEBOOKPLATE OF FRANCIS DE MALHERBE REPRODUCED OVER LEAF WHICH AS THEOWNER DIED IN  WAS ENGRAVED PROBABLY SOON AFTER THE OPENING OFTHE CENTURY. IN THIS CASE WE HAVE A STATEMENT BY DE MALHERBE THAT HISARMS ARE DARGENT  SIX ROSES DE GUEULES ET DES HERMINES DE SABLE SANSNOMBREA DESCRIPTION OBVIOUSLY INACCURATE. DE MALHERBE WAS A POETAND COULD NO MORE BE EXPECTED TO DESCRIBE A COAT OF ARMS THAN GARTERCOULD BE EXPECTED TO WRITE A POEM. THE PROPER BLAZONING OF HIS FAMILYARMS IS ERMINE SIX ROSES GULES. BUT ACCORDING TO THE LINES DEPICTEDON HIS BOOKPLATE THE FIELD WOULD BE AZURE CLEARLY IN THIS CASETHE LINES MEAN NOTHING AT ALL.THE LATE MR. J. E. BAILEY POINTS OUT THAT IN THE   AND EDITIONS OF GERARD LEGHS ACCEDENS OF ARMORY SABLE BLACK ISEXPRESSED AS IT WOULD BE NOW BY HORIZONTAL AND PERPENDICULAR LINESCROSSING EACH OTHER WHILST THE OTHER COLOURS ARE REPRESENTED BY THEINITIALS OF THEIR NAMES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THIS FORM OF EXPRESSINGSABLE MAY BE MERELY THE RESULT OF AN ATTEMPT ON THE PART OF THE ENGRAVERTO PRODUCE AS DARK A TINT AS POSSIBLE TO REPRESENT IT. IN VINCENTSDISCOVERY OF BROOKES ERRORS  SUCH LINES ARE CERTAINLY USED ASSHADING OR TO DISTINGUISH COLOUR FROM WHITE BUT AS SHOWN FROM HISVERBAL DESCRIPTION OF THE ARMS HE REPRESENTS THESE LINES ARE USEDWITHOUT ANY SYSTEM WHATEVER PERPENDICULAR LINES SOMETIMES REPRESENTINGGULES AND SOMETIMES AZURE. AGAIN IN THE SECOND EDITION OF GUILLIMSDISPLAY  LINES ARE USED TO DENOTE THE DARKER COLOURS THOUGHTHEY ARE USED WITHOUT SYSTEM. BUT IN  WE FIND IN BYSSHES HERALDICTRACTS GULES AZURE SABLE AND THE REST EXPRESSED IN THE NOW ORTHODOXMANNER AND AN EXPLANATORY PLATE SHOWING WHAT COLOURS ARE REPRESENTED BYTHE RESPECTIVE DOTS OR LINES A CONCLUSIVE PROOF OF THE NOVELTY OF THESYSTEM IN ENGLAND. I THINK THE READER WILL SEE AS HE PROCEEDS THATTHIS HAS BEEN A USEFUL DIGRESSION.ILLUSTRATION BOOKPLATE OF FRANCIS DE MALHERBE.WE HAVE SAID THAT THE EARLIEST ENGLISH BOOKPLATE YET COME TO LIGHT ISCARDINAL WOLSEYS. THIS IS NOT A PRINTED BOOKPLATE AT ALL BUT ACAREFULLY DRAWN SKETCH OF THE CARDINALS ARMS WITH SUPPORTERS ANDSURMOUNTED BY A CARDINALS HAT THE WHOLE COLOURED BY HAND. HOW MANY OFTHESE BOOKPLATES THE CARDINAL POSSESSED WE DO NOT KNOW BUT THATTHISTHE ONLY EXAMPLE KNOWNIS UNDOUBTEDLY A BOOKPLATE IS PROVEDFROM THE FACT THAT IT MAY NOW BE SEEN IN A FOLIO VOLUME WHICH ONCEBELONGED TO WOLSEY AND SUBSEQUENTLY TO HIS ROYAL MASTER. IT BEARS NODATE AND MAY HAVE BEEN DESIGNED ANY TIME AFTER THE MINISTERS ELEVATIONTO THE CARDINALATE IN SEPTEMBER . IT IS A SPLENDID AFFAIR IN EVERYWAY AND GORGEOUSLY COLOURED. THE SHIELD OF ARMS RESTS ON A PLATFORMGOLD THE FRONT OF WHICH IS RED ORNAMENTED WITH AN ARABESQUE PATTERNALSO RED PILLARS ON THE PLATFORM SUPPORT A CANOPY ORNAMENTED AS THEFRONT OF THE PLATFORM WITH THE ADDITION OF TUDOR ROSES OVER THE SHIELDIS THE CARDINALS HAT AND ABOVE THAT AGAIN THE HOLY DOVE DESCENDS. THESHIELD IS SUPPORTED BY TWO DINGYLOOKING GRIFFINS WHOSE WINGS AND HEADSARE RED AND WHOSE BEAKS CLAWS AND TAILTIPS ARE GOLD THE BACKGROUNDIS BLUE.ILLUSTRATION BOOKPLATE OF SIR NICHOLAS BACON.NEXT IN DATE AFTER WOLSEYS BOOKPLATE COMES THAT WHICH WAS IBELIEVE ENGRAVED AT LEAST CONTEMPORANEOUSLY WITH THE DATE UPON IT TO PLACE IN THE VOLUMES GIVEN IN THAT YEAR BY SIR NICHOLAS BACONTO THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE. BACON DIED FIVE YEARS AFTER THIS DATEHE IS FAMILIAR TO US ALL AS THE FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY AND OF SIRFRANCIS BACON. THIS BOOKPLATE IS ENGRAVED ON WOOD LIKE WOLSEYS ITIS FOUND COLOURED BUT IT IS ALSOAMONGST THE ODDS AND ENDS IN THEBAGFORD COLLECTIONFOUND UNCOLOURED AND WITHOUT THE INSCRIPTION WHICHRECORDS THE GIFT TO CAMBRIDGE. A FACSIMILE OF THAT IN THE BAGFORDCOLLECTION APPEARS OPPOSITE CAN IT BE THE BOOKPLATE OF BACON HIMSELFTO WHICH ON THE COPIES USED FOR THE BOOKS THAT HE GAVE TO CAMBRIDGEWAS ADDED THE DONATORY INSCRIPTION A CLOSE COMPARISON SHOWS THAT BOTHSHIELDS OF ARMS ARE STRUCK FROM THE SAME BLOCK. THE ARMS SHOWN ARE BACONQUARTERING QUAPLODE. THE VARIETY OF THIS BOOKPLATE WHICH BEARS THEINSCRIPTION BELONGS TO WHAT ARE TERMED GIFT OR LEGACY BOOKPLATESTHE DATES ON WHICHAS THEY REFER TO THE DATE OF THE GIFT OR LEGACYCOMMEMORATEDARE CONSIDERED EARLIER THAN THE ENGRAVING. IN THE CASEOF LEGACY BOOKPLATES THEY MAY OFTEN BE SO BUT THEY ARE NOT I THINKIN MANY CASES OF GIFT BOOKPLATES. FOR INSTANCE IF AS FROM THEBAGFORD EXAMPLE SEEMS PROBABLE THIS WAS BACONS OWN BOOKPLATE THEDATE UPON IT  MAY EVEN BE MANY YEARS LATER THAN THE TIME ATWHICH IT WAS MADE FOR HIM. THAT THE DATE ON ONE OF THESE GIFTBOOKPLATES MUST BE WITHIN A VERY SHORT SPACE OF TIME THE DATE OF ITSENGRAVING WILL BE SHOWN PRESENTLY WHEN I COME TO SPEAK OF THATRECORDING A DONATION MADE BY LADY BATH.ILLUSTRATIONTHE NEXT ENGLISH BOOKPLATE WHICH BEARS UPON IT AN ENGRAVED DATE IS THATOF SIR THOMAS TRESHAM. ON THIS THE INSCRIPTION READS JUNE  WHICH NO DOUBT REFERS TO THE DATE OF ENGRAVING OR PROBABLY TO THEDATE AT WHICH THE DESIGN FOR THE ENGRAVING WAS FINISHED BY THE ARTIST.AS A WORK OF ART IT IS POOR BUT ITS INTEREST AS A BOOKPLATE TOCOLLECTORS IS NOT LESSENED ON THAT ACCOUNT. TRESHAM WAS KNIGHTED BYQUEEN ELIZABETH TEN YEARS BEFORE THE DATE OF HIS BOOKPLATE. WE KNOW NOTMUCH OF HIM SAVE WHAT FULLER TELLS US THAT HE WAS FAMOUS FOR HIS SKILLIN BUILDINGS. ONE OF HIS SONS SIR FRANCIS WAS INVOLVED IN THEGUNPOWDER PLOT AND ANOTHER SIR LEWIS WAS MADE A BARONET IN .THESE THREE EXAMPLES ARE ALL THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY ENGLISH DATEDBOOKPLATES YET BROUGHT TO LIGHT. THOSE IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY AREFAR MORE NUMEROUS. WE FIND ONE BEARING THE DATE  WHICH WASPREPARED TO PLACE IN THE VOLUMES GIVEN IN THAT YEAR BY WILLIAMWILLMER A NORTHAMPTONSHIRE SQUIRE TO HIS COLLEGE LIBRARY. THEINSCRIPTION ON IT READS SYDNEY SUSSEX COLLEDGEEX DONO WILHELMIWILLMER DE SYWELL IN COM. NORTHAMTONI ARMIGERI QUONDAM PENTIONARII INISTA DOMI SIC VIZ. IN ANNO DI  SED DEDIT IN ANO DI .THE BOOKPLATE IS CLEARLY EARLY AND SHOWS US FINE BOLD HERALDIC WORK.IN STYLE IT NEARLY RESEMBLES THE BACON PLATE AND THAT OF SIR THOMASTRESHAM BUT THE MANTLING HERE DESCENDS TO THE BASE OF THE SHIELD. THEWILLMER PLATE IS IN DR. HOWARDS COLLECTION A REPRODUCTION OF IT ISGIVEN IN MR. GRIGGSS EXAMPLES OF ARMORIAL BOOKPLATES.EARLY IN THE REIGN OF CHARLES I. MAY BE PLACED A VERY BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLEOF HERALDIC ENGRAVING WHICH SIR WOLLASTON FRANKS SATISFACTORILY ASSIGNSTO A CERTAIN JOHN TALBOT OF THORNETON WHO DIED IN . IT IS INSCRIBEDCOLL. TALBOTT AND THIS JOHN TALBOT IS CALLED COLONELLUS EX PARTEREGIS THE QUARTERINGS ARE THOSE OF THE FAMILIES OF FERRERS BELLARSAND ARDERNE.IN STRANGE CONTRAST TO THIS FINE WORK IS THE WOOD BLOCK BOOKPLATE OFWILLIAM COURTENAY OF TREEMER IN THE COUNTY OF CORNWALL ESQUIREWHO IN  INHERITED THE TREEMER ESTATE. WE MAY NOTE THAT NOT ONLYIS THIS BOOKPLATE LIKE ALL THOSE YET DESCRIBED FREE FROM ANYINDICATION OF LINES OR DOTS TO EXPRESS THE COLOURS IN THE ARMORIALBEARINGS BUT BELOW THE SHIELD IS GIVEN A VERBAL BLAZON OF THE COAT HEBEARETH OR  TORTEAUXES.THIS SEEMS TO BE THE PLACE TO SPEAK OF A VERY PUZZLING PAIR OFENGRAVINGS WHICH CERTAINLY APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN USED AS BOOKPLATESDATED IN . THEY REPRESENT THE ARMORIAL BEARINGS OF SIR EDWARDDERING. ONE OF THESE BOOKPLATES WHICH I TAKE TO BE THE EARLIER SHOWS ALESS NUMBER OF QUARTERINGS AND CONTAINS NO INDICATION OF A REALLYSYSTEMATIC EXPRESSION OF THE METALS AND TINCTURES IN THE ARMS BUT THEOTHER AND LATER EXAMPLE DOES. THE SAME DATE APPEARS UPON EACH. THESECOND OF THE TWO PLATES OCCURS BOUND UP IN A VOLUME OF THE HARLEIANCOLLECTION OF MSS. AND MR. HUMPHREY WANLY LIBRARYKEEPER TO ROBERTAND EDWARD EARLS OF OXFORD IN HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIMEN IN THEHARLEIAN COLLECTION CALLS IT A PRINTED CUT OF THE ARMS OR ATCHIEVEMENTOF SIR EDWARD DERING BARONET DATED A.D.  WITH A FANCIFUL MOTTO INMISSHAPEN SAXON CHARACTERS BUT BY THE HATCHING OF THE ARMS IN ORDER TOSHOW THE COLOURS ACCORDING TO THE WAY FOUND OUT BY SIR EDWARD BYSSHE IGUESS THAT IT IS NOT SO OLD.NOW THE HARLEIAN VOLUME IN WHICH THIS ENGRAVING OCCURS IS A COPYWRITTEN IN  OF THE HERALDS VISITATION OF KENT IN  AND IN ALATER BUT CERTAINLY SEVENTEENTH CENTURY HANDWRITING IS A DESCRIPTIONOF THE NUMEROUS QUARTERINGS AS THEY APPEAR ON THE ENGRAVING SO THATWHILST REJECTING THE CLAIM OF THIS VARIETY OF THE PLATE TO BE ANENGRAVING OF  WE MAY I THINK ACCEPT IT AS AT LEAST AN EARLYEXAMPLE OF THE INDICATION OF THE COLOURS AND TINCTURES BY LINES ANDDOTS. AS FOR THE FIRST OF THE TWO VARIETIES I DO NOT SEE WHY IT SHOULDNOT BE AS EARLY AS THE DATE UPON IT THERE WAS NO PARTICULAR REASON INSELECTING THAT DATE FOR I DO NOT FIND THAT IT REFERS TO ANY SPECIALEVENT IN SIR EDWARDS LIFE. A WRITER TO NOTES AND QUERIES IN STATES THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL LOOSE COPIES OF THE PLATEWHICHVARIETY HE DOES NOT SAYIN THE SURRENDEN COLLECTION AND DR. HOWARDSAW IT INSERTED IN SEVERAL FOLIO VOLUMES OF THAT COLLECTION WHEN ITWAS DISPOSED OF BY MESSRS. PUTTICK AND SIMPSON. VERY GOOD FACSIMILES OFTHESE BOOKPLATES HAVE BEEN GIVEN BY DR. HOWARD IN HIS MISCELLANEAGENEALOGICA ET HERALDICA.ANOTHER EARLY INSTANCE OF THE EXPRESSION OF THE METALS AND TINCTURESOCCURS IN THE BOOKPLATE OF LORDKEEPER LYTTELTON A PLATE WHICH DERIVESADDITIONAL INTEREST FROM THE FACT OF ITS BEING THE WORK OF WILLIAMMARSHALL THE FAMOUS FRONTISPIECE ENGRAVER. SIR EDWARD LYTTELTON THEOWNER OF THE BOOKPLATE WAS MADE LORDKEEPER IN  UNDER THE TITLEOF BARON LYTTELTON OF MOUNSLOW. THIS BOOKPLATE WHICH SHOWS US THE ARMSOF LYTTELTON OF FRANKLEY WAS EVIDENTLY ENGRAVED BEFORE SIR EDWARDSELEVATION TO THE PEERAGE. THE BOOKPLATE WHICH IS THE EARLIEST ENGLISHEXAMPLE BEARING AN ENGRAVERS SIGNATURE MAY BE DATED ABOUT .WE KNOW FROM THE ARMS ON DEDICATION PLATES AND THE LIKE THAT THEEXPRESSION OF COLOURS ON SHIELDS DID NOT BECOME AT ALL GENERAL FOR MANYYEARS AFTER . TAKE FOR INSTANCE HOLLARS CUTS OF ARMS IN THEILLUSTRATIONS TO DUGDALES MONASTICON OR HIS HISTORY OF ST. PAULS.THUS WE MUST NOT DATE EVERY BOOKPLATE WE FIND ON WHICH THE COLOURSARE NOT SHOWN IN THE NEW FASHION AS BEFORE . THE SMALL ANDUNPRETENTIOUS BOOKPLATE OF JOHN MARSHAM OF WHOMS PLACE NEAR CUXTONIN KENT IS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THIS. A REPRESENTATION OF IT IS GIVEN BYMR. GRIGGS IN HIS FACSIMILES. MARSHAM WAS MADE A BARONET IN  SOTHE PLATE IS EARLIER THAN THAT BUT AS IT IS EXACTLY IN THE STYLE OF THEDEDICATORY PLATES IN THE WORKS JUST NOTICED WE MAY PLACE IT SOMEWHEREABOUT . IT IS PERHAPS BY HOLLAR. LIKELY ENOUGH OTHER EXAMPLES WILLCOME TO LIGHT.AFTER THE RESTORATION THE NUMBER OF ENGLISH BOOKPLATES PERCEPTIBLYINCREASES THOUGH WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THE ACTIVE SUPPORTERS OFCROMWELL DID NOT OBJECT TO A LITTLE HERALDIC DISPLAYTHERE WAS A FAIRAMOUNT OF HERALDIC WORK ONE WAY AND ANOTHER EXECUTED BOTH WITH PEN ANDPENCIL DURING THE TWELVE YEARS THAT THE KING WAS KEPT OFF HIS THRONE.TWO OF THE EARLIEST POSTRESTORATION BOOKPLATES ARE THOSE OF SIR EDWARDBYSSHE AND HIS BROTHERINLAW JOHN GREENE. SIR EDWARD BYSSHE BECAMEGARTER KINGATARMS AND JOHN GREENE WAS OF NAVESTOCK ESSEX. BOTH ARECURIOUS OBLONG PLATES HAVING FANCIFULLY SHAPED SHIELDS SURROUNDED BYPALM BRANCHES AND HELD UP BY RIBBONS. THERE IS NO CREST SHOWN INEITHER. THEY ARE EVIDENTLY BY THE SAME ARTIST WHICH AS BYSSHE ANDGREENE WERE BROTHERSINLAW IS PERHAPS NATURAL. A SOMEWHAT SIMILARTHOUGH PLAINER FORM OF ORNAMENTATION SURROUNDS THE SHIELDS ON TWO OTHERANONYMOUS BOOKPLATES ONE BEARING THE ARMS OF SOUTHWELL AND THE OTHERTHOSE OF EYNES OR HAYNES.ILLUSTRATION BOOKPLATE OF THOMAS GORE BY MICHAEL BURGHERS.THOMAS GORE OF ALDERTON WILTS THE AUTHOR OF CATALOGUS DE REHERALDIC IS A MAN WHO MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO USE A BOOKPLATE AND HEDID. THREE VARIETIES ARE KNOWN. THE FIRST WHICH DATES ABOUT THOUGH A MORE ELABORATE PIECE OF WORK THAN THOSE LAST DESCRIBED ISSOMEWHAT SIMILAR IN STYLE OR PERHAPS IT WOULD BE MORE ACCURATE TO SAYDISSIMILAR TO THE STYLE IN WHICH OTHER BOOKPLATES PRIOR TO THERESTORATION WERE DESIGNED. WHOEVER ENGRAVED THIS PLATE FOR GORE ALSOENGRAVED THE ARMS OF EDWARD WATERHOUSEMOST PROBABLY THE ENGRAVING WASINTENDED FOR WATERHOUSES BOOKPLATEWHICH APPEAR AS A FRONTISPIECE TOHIS DISCOURSE AND DEFENCE OF ARMS AND ARMORY . IN HIS SECONDBOOKPLATE GORE CALLED TO HIS AID THE FOREIGNERS ART EMPLOYING MICHAELBURGHERS A DUTCH ARTIST WHO HAD RECENTLY COME FROM HOLLAND AND SETTLEDAT OXFORD. MICHAEL PRODUCED THE BOOKPLATE FIGURED OPPOSITE WHICHINTRODUCES SOME RATHER WILD ALLEGORY SINGULARLY PLAIN CUPIDS SEATED ONTHE BACKS OF FLYING EAGLES. PERHAPS GORE DID NOT CARE FOR THISALLEGORYALLEGORY SEEMS NEVER TO HAVE BEEN POPULAR WITH ENGLISHBOOKPLATE OWNERS SEE CHAPTER IV.AND FOR HIS THIRD PLATE WENT TO ANENGLISHMAN AND TO A NO LESS EMINENT ONE THAN WILLIAM FAITHORNE. THEFAMOUS PORTRAITENGRAVER PRODUCED AS BEAUTIFUL AND BOLD A BOOKPLATE INTHE SIMPLE ARMORIAL STYLE AS COULD WELL BE THE PECULIAR DEPTH OF HISTOUCH IS APPARENT HERE AND IN HIS OTHER BOOKPLATES OF WHICH THERE ARESEVERAL.ILLUSTRATION BOOKPLATE OF THE MARRIOTT FAMILY BY FAITHORNEIT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT FAITHORNE REVERTS TO THE PRERESTORATIONSTYLE AND IMPROVES UPON IT. THE MANTLING IS MUCH RICHER THAN THAT SHOWNIN EARLIER EXAMPLES IN THE SAME STYLE AND IT MORE COMPLETELY SURROUNDSTHE SHIELD. TO FAITHORNE MAY BE ASSIGNED TWO OTHER MAGNIFICENTBOOKPLATES THAT OF SIR GEORGE HUNGERFORD OF CADENHAM ANONYMOUS ANDTHE ONE HERE REPRODUCED OF A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY OF MARRIOTT OFWHITCHURCH WARWICKSHIRE AND ALSCOT AND PRESTON GLOUCESTERSHIRE.THE HUNGERFORD BOOKPLATE IS NOTEWORTHY. THE NAME OF SIR GEORGEHUNGERFORD ITS POSSESSOR DOES NOT OCCUR IN ANY LIST OF BARONETS YETHE EVIDENTLY CONSIDERED HIMSELF TO POSSESS THAT DIGNITY AS THE BLOODYHAND OF ULSTER FIGURES ON HIS ARMS. DUGDALE TOO IN SPEAKING OF SIRGEORGES MARRIAGE REFERS TO HIM AS BARONET. FAITHORNE ALSO PRODUCED ABOOKPLATE TO COMMEMORATE A GIFT OF BOOKS MADE BY BISHOP HACKET WHODIED IN IT IS PARTICULARLY CURIOUS AS SHOWING US THE BISHOPSPORTRAIT. I SHALL SPEAK OF IT LATER ON UNDER THE HEADING PORTRAITBOOKPLATES PP.  SUCH PLATES ARE COMPARATIVELY FEW IN NUMBER.DATED AND MOST PROBABLY ENGRAVED IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR  ISANOTHER GIFT BOOKPLATE PREPARED TO PLACE IN BOOKS PRESENTED BY THETHEN COUNTESSDOWAGER OF BATH. THE INSCRIPTION READS EX DONO RACHELCOMITISS BATHON DOTARI AN DOM. MDCLXXI. THIS LADY WAS BORN IN SHE WAS A DAUGHTER OF FRANCIS FANE FIRST EARL OF WESTMORELAND ANDBECAME THE WIFE OF HENRY BOURCHIER EARL OF BATH WHO DIED IN  ANDSOON AFTERWARDS OF LIONEL CRANFIELD EARL OF MIDDLESEX WHO DIED IN SHE HERSELF DYING IN . THERE IS NO REASON TO DOUBT THE DATE ONTHIS BOOKPLATE  THOUGH AT FIRST SIGHT IT MAY LOOK A LITTLESUSPICIOUS. TRUE SHE HAD BECOME THE WIFE OF THE EARL OF MIDDLESEX ATITLE ONLY DATING FROM  IN  AND WAS STILL HIS WIFE IN BUT SHE HAD APPARENTLY LITTLE REASON TO BE PROUD OF HIM OR HIS TITLEFOR HE LEFT HER AND MADE HAY OF HER FORTUNE SPENDING IT TO USE THEWORDS OF A CONTEMPORARY LETTER IN PLAY AND RIOTING. WE CANNOTTHEREFORE FEEL MUCH SURPRISED AT HER DESIRE TO PASS BY HER FORMER TITLEWHICH WOULD GIVE HER RANK AT COURT AS THE WIDOW OF AN EARL WHOSECREATION WAS HARD ON A CENTURY EARLIER. OUR COUSIN LADY BATH WRITESLADY NEWPORT IN APRIL  HATH GOT HER PLACE OF BEING LADY BATHAGAIN IT COST HER L . . . HER LORD IS VERY ANGRY AT HER CHANGINGHER TITLE HE SAYS IT IS AN AFFRONT TO HIM. THAT IS WHY SHE CALLSHERSELF ON THE BOOKPLATE UNDER NOTICE COUNTESSDOWAGER OF BATH IN. A CURIOUS FEATURE ABOUT THE BOOKPLATE IS THAT IT DOES NOT SEEMTO HAVE BEEN PREPARED TO PLACE IN BOOKS INCLUDED IN ONE PARTICULAR GIFTTO A PARTICULAR PERSON OR INSTITUTION BUT RATHER TO HAVE BEEN THEOUTCOME OF MY LADYS FANCY TO PLACE SUCH A REMEMBRANCE OF HERSELF IN ANYVOLUME SHE GAVE AWAY AT THAT OR AT ANY SUBSEQUENT DATE. THE COUNTESSALSO USED A BOOKSTAMP OF THE SAME DESIGN AS THE EX LIBRIS BUTWITHOUT THE INSCRIPTION.WHILST SPEAKING ON THE SUBJECT OF GIFT BOOKPLATES REFERENCE MAYAPPROPRIATELY BE MADE TO A CURIOUS WOODCUT USED AS A BOOKPLATE BY THEST. ALBANS GRAMMAR SCHOOL WHICH IS FIGURED OPPOSITE THE NEXT PAGE. ITIS A QUAINT BIT OF NO DOUBT LOCAL WORK AND AS POINTED OUT TO ME BYTHE REV. F. WILLCOX THE HEADMASTER DURING A LONG AND DUSTY HUNTOCCURS ONLY IN THE VOLUMES GIVEN TO THE SCHOOL BY SIR SAMUEL GRIMSTON.THE PLATE SHOWS US A COMBINATION OF THE ARMS OF THE CITY OF ST. ALBANSAND THE MOTTO OF THE BACON FAMILY ADOPTED BY THE GRIMSTONS.I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IF A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF THE TOO OFTENNEGLECTED LIBRARIES OF OUR OLD FOUNDATION GRAMMAR SCHOOLS WERE MADEOTHER EARLY AND CURIOUS BOOKPLATES MIGHT BE DISCOVERED.BETWEEN  AND  QUITE A NUMBER OF BOOKPLATES WERE DESIGNEDEVIDENTLY BY THE SAME MAN. THE WORK IS FEEBLE BUT IT IS VERY DISTINCT.THE MOST INTERESTING OF THESE BOOKPLATES FROM ITS POSSESSOR IS THATOF SAMUEL PEPYS. ALTOGETHER I KNOW OF EIGHT EXAMPLES CHARLES PITFIELDSIR ROBERT SOUTHWELL WILLIAM WHARTON SIR HENRY HUNLOKE SAMUEL PEPYSJUSTINIAN PAGIT WALTER CHETWYND AND RANDOLPH EGERTON.A POINT OF INTEREST ABOUT THEM ALL IS THAT AS WELL AS EXPRESSINGHERALDICALLY THE BLAZON OF THE DIFFERENT SHIELDS THEY ALSO INDICATEWITH AN INITIAL LETTER THE COLOUR INTENDED TO BE SHOWN A FOR ARGENTG FOR GULES AND SO ON. THE INITIAL OF THE HERALDIC TERM IS USED INEVERY CASE EXCEPT THAT OF AZURE WHEN B FOR BLUE IS USED A AS WEHAVE SEEN STANDING FOR ARGENT.THOUGH THEY DIFFER IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE MANTLING THERE CAN BELITTLE DOUBT THAT ALL THESE BOOKPLATES ARE BY THE SAME HAND AND THATWHOEVER ENGRAVED THE PLATES IN BLOMES GWILIM ENGRAVED THESE ALSO.THE BOOKPLATE OF FETTIPLACE NOTT WHICH BEARS THE DATE  IS AFAIR TYPE OF THE BOOKPLATE THAT WAS IN USE IN ENGLAND FOR THE NEXTTWENTY YEARS INDEED THESE MIGHT ALL BE THE WORK OF HALF A DOZENARTISTS.ILLUSTRATION BOOKPLATE OF THE ST. ALBANS GRAMMAR SCHOOL SEVENTEENTHCENTURY.I HAVE NOT YET MENTIONED A VERY NUMEROUS AND VERY UNINTERESTING CLASS OFEARLY ENGLISH BOOKPLATESI MEAN THOSE WHICH ARE NOTHING MORE THANNAMETICKETSTHE OWNERS NAME AND DATE PRINTED WITHIN A BORDER MOREOR LESS ORNATE. THESE OCCUR QUITE EARLY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY ANDRUN ALL THROUGH IT. OF COURSE IT MAY BE THAT THE OWNER IS ANINTERESTING PERSON AND THEN HIS OR HER NAMETICKET BECOMES INTERESTINGBY REFLECTION BUT IN THEMSELVES THESE TICKETS ARE MERELY DULL. OFENGLISH ARMORIAL PLATES I HAVE REFERRED IN DETAIL TO THE MAJORITY OFTHOSE BEARING AN ENGRAVED DATEWHEN THAT DATE IS NOT OBVIOUSLYMISLEADINGPRIOR TO THE YEAR . I HAVE ALSO SPOKEN OF SEVERALTHOUGH BY NO MEANS ALL OF THE UNDATED EXAMPLES WHICH HAVE BEEN PROVEDTO BELONG TO THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY. TO THIS SECOND LIST A PATIENTWORKING OUT OF THE INTERNAL EVIDENCE ON EARLYLOOKING BUT UNDATEDBOOKPLATES WOULD NO DOUBT ADD VERY CONSIDERABLY AND THEILLUSTRATIONS VERBAL AND OTHERWISE THAT I HAVE GIVEN MAY I HOPE BESUFFICIENT TO INDICATE THE KIND OF BOOKPLATES THAT ARE WORTH SUCHINVESTIGATION.I HAVE USED THE DATE  AS A STOPPINGPOINT BECAUSE FROM THAT YEAR WEHAVE DATED EXAMPLES OF ENGLISH BOOKPLATES YEARLY DOWN TO THECOMMENCEMENT OF THE PRESENT CENTURY. HERE LET ME SAY A WORD ON THESUBJECT OF DATED BOOKPLATES GENERALLY. THE DATE IS CERTAINLY ANADVANTAGE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT CLEARLY REFERS TO THE DATE OF THEENGRAVING AND NOT AS WE HAVE SEEN IT SOMETIMES DOES TO AN EVENT INTHE OWNERS CAREER BUT I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE MARKET VALUE OF ABOOKPLATE SHOULD BE ENHANCED TO SUCH AN EXTENT AS IT IS BY THE PRESENCEON THAT BOOKPLATE OF AN ENGRAVED DATE. THERE ARE PROBABLY FEWBOOKPLATES WHICH DO NOT BEAR SOME MARK BY WHICH AN APPROXIMATE DATE CANBE SAFELY AFFIXED TO THEM AND THE STUDY OF THESE MARKS IS A VERYDESIRABLE UNDERTAKING. THE GREAT VALUE OF A PRINTED DATE ON A BOOKPLATEIS THAT ONE CAN SEE FROM IT THE STYLE OF DECORATION IN VOGUE AT APARTICULAR PERIOD AND THUS OBTAIN THE MEANS FOR ARRANGINGCHRONOLOGICALLY UNDATED EXAMPLES. FOR THERE WERE DURING CERTAIN YEARSCERTAIN MARKED STYLES OF DECORATION ADOPTED BY BOOKPLATE ENGRAVERS BUTOF THESE I PROPOSE TO SPEAK LATER ON UNDER THE HEADING OF STYLES.LET ME ALSO MENTION MISLEADING DATES ON BOOKPLATES AND FOR THISPURPOSE IT WILL BE SUFFICIENT IF I TAKE PRINCIPALLY THE EXAMPLES CITEDBY MR. J. PAUL RYLANDS F.S.A. IN HIS NOTES ON LANCASHIRE AND CHESHIREEXAMPLES. THE DATE ON SIR WILLIAM ST. QUINTINS BOOKPLATE  ISTHAT AT WHICH THE BARONETCY WAS CREATED THE BOOKPLATE WAS ENGRAVED INTHE LAST CENTURY. SIR FRANCIS FUSTS BOOKPLATE ONE REMARKABLE FOR ITSSIZE AND UGLINESS IS INSCRIBED SR FRANCIS FUST OF HILL COURT IN THECOUNTY OF GLOUCESTER BARONET CREATED ST AUGUST  THE  YEAR OFKING CHARLES D. NOW THIS PLATE CANNOT BE EARLIER THAN  THE YEARIN WHICH THE FIRST SIR FRANCIS SUCCEEDED TO THE BARONETCY. HEREHOWEVER THE CONTEXT OF WORDS CREATED ST AUGUST  RENDERS THEINSCRIPTION LESS LIKELY TO MISLEAD PEOPLE INTO SUPPOSING THAT  WASTHE YEAR IN WHICH THE PLATE WAS EXECUTED. IN OTHER INSTANCES WE HAVE NOTTHIS HELP.THE DATE  ON THE BOOKPLATE OF GILBERT NICHOLSON OF BALRATH MERELYREFERS TO THE DATE AT WHICH GILBERT ACQUIRED HIS IRISH ESTATES THEEXAMPLE ITSELF MUST BE LATER THAN  AS THE SAME COPPER WAS EMPLOYEDFOR IT AS THAT ON WHICH THE BOOKPLATE OF THOMAS CARTER DATED IN THATYEAR HAD BEEN ENGRAVED. AGAIN SOME COLLECTORS HOLD AND HAVEMAINTAINED IN PRINT THAT THE BOOKPLATE OF SIR ROBERT CLAYTON OF WHICHWE MUST SPEAK AGAIN HEREAFTER WAS NOT REALLY ENGRAVED IN THE DATEWHICH APPEARS UPON IT.  IS THE YEAR IN WHICH SIR ROBERT WAS LORDMAYOR OF LONDON AND IT IS THOUGHT PROBABLE THAT THE BOOKPLATE WASENGRAVED LATERPERHAPS IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURYWHEN AS WE HAVE SEEN THE FASHION OF HAVING A BOOKPLATE WAS SOPREVALENTAND THAT SIR ROBERT PLACED THE DATE  UPON IT IN ORDER TOCOMMEMORATE THE DATE OF HIS MAYORALTY. FOR MY PART I SEE NO PARTICULARREASON FOR HOLDING THIS VIEW THE STYLE IN WHICH THE PLATE IS EXECUTEDDOES NOT SEEM TO ME CONTRADICTORY TO THE DATE UPON IT. STILL AS THEDOUBT EXISTS IT IS BETTER TO MENTION IT.ATTENTION HAS BEEN CALLED TO A BOOKPLATE OF DAVID PAYNTER OF DALECASTLE PEMBROKESHIRE  WHICH IS PROBABLY NEARLY A CENTURY LATER.THE BOOKPLATE OF WILLIAM TWEMLOW OF HATHERTON CHESHIRE ESQUIRE WAS ENGRAVED FOR A MR. WILLIAM TWEMLOW WHO DIED IN .ILLUSTRATIONON THE OTHER HAND THERE ARE CERTAIN BOOKPLATES WHICH WERE ENGRAVEDEARLIER THAN THE DATES WHICH APPEAR UPON SOME IMPRESSIONS OF THEM. THEBOOKPLATE OF THE STATESMAN CHARLES JAMES FOX SEE OPPOSITE IS ONEINSTANCE OF THIS. IT IS INSCRIBED THE HONBLE CHARLES JAMES FOX ANDWAS USED BY THE GREAT STATESMAN BUT THE PLATE WAS ENGRAVED IN ASITS STYLE SUGGESTSFOR HIS HALFUNCLE AND THE INSCRIPTION BEFORE ITSALTERATION READCHARLES FOX OF THE PARISH OF ST. MARTINSINTHEFIELDSESQ. .THERE IS A LARGE BOOKPLATE SHOWN BY ITS STYLE TO HAVE BEEN ENGRAVED INTHE EARLY YEARS OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY BUT WHICH IS INSCRIBEDMARTIN STAPYLTON ESQ. OF MYTON IN THE COUNTY OF YORK A.D. . THEBOOKPLATE WAS EVIDENTLY ENGRAVED FOR SIR BRYAN STAPYLTON WHO DIED IN. THE MARTIN STAPYLTON WHO ALTERED AND USED IT WAS ONE MARTINBREENEPHEW OF THE LAST BARONET WHO DIED IN WHO SUCCEEDED TO HISUNCLES PROPERTY BUT NOT TO HIS BARONETCY HENCE HE WAS NOT JUSTIFIEDIN LEAVING THE HELMET OF A KNIGHT OR BARONET UPON IT HE REMOVED THEBLOODY HAND OF ULSTER FROM THE SHIELD BUT THE MISTAKE IN THE HELMETDOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE STRUCK HIM. ON A SMALL VARIETY OF THIS BOOKPLATETHE INSCRIPTION ON WHICH IS SIMILARLY ALTERED THE BLOODY HANDREMAINS.AGAIN THE BOOKPLATE OF SR WILLM ROBINSON BARONETT OF NEWBYIN THE COUNTY OF YORK  WAS ALTEREDBY TURNING THE  INTO AINTO  AND WAS USED BY HIS GRANDSON THAT INSCRIBED JOHNPEACHEY  DESIGNED IN THE CHIPPENDALE STYLE IS QUITE TWENTY YEARSEARLIER AND THAT OF FR. DICKENS ARMIG.  WAS CERTAINLY ENGRAVEDHALF A CENTURY BEFORE.DURING THE TEN OR TWELVE YEARS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE YEAR  THENUMBER OF ENGLISH DATED BOOKPLATES IS EXCEEDINGLY LARGE. TAKING THELIST PRINTED FOR PRIVATE DISTRIBUTION BY SIR WOLLASTON FRANKS IN WE FIND SIXTEEN EXAMPLES IN  SEVEN IN  FIFTEEN IN SIXTEEN IN  FORTYFOUR IN  FIFTYEIGHT IN  TWENTYSEVENIN  AND MANY BUT NOT SO MANY IN THE SUCCEEDING YEARS.SOMETHINGWHAT I HAVE FAILED TO DISCOVERMUST HAVE GIVEN A STIMULUSTO THE FASHION OF USING BOOKPLATES JUST AT THE CLOSE OF THE SEVENTEENTHAND OPENING OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY AND NOT ONLY TO USING THEM BUTALSO TO PUTTING A DATE ON THOSE USED. IT IS A FACT THAT IT IS MORE RARETO FIND BOOKPLATES ENGRAVED IN THIS PARTICULAR STYLE WITHOUT DATES THANWITH THEM.THE FASHION OF DATING AS A RULE WENT OUT ABOUT THE YEAR  ABOUTTHE TIME AT WHICH AS WE SHALL SEE A NEW STYLE IN BOOKPLATES BECAMEGENERALLY ADOPTED. ANONYMOUS BOOKPLATES ARE RARE AFTER THIS DATETHOUGH BOTH IN ENGLAND AND ON THE CONTINENT THEY WERE IN EARLY TIMESCERTAINLY COMMONA FACT WHICH BEARS SILENT TESTIMONY TO THE MUCHGREATER INTIMACY WHICH PEOPLE IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS HAD WITH THEIRNEIGHBOURS ARMORIAL BEARINGS. THE COAT OF ARMS OF A MAN OF POSITION WASALMOST AS WELL KNOWN TO THOSE DWELLING ABOUT HIM AS WERE THE FEATURES OFHIS FACE AND IF A VOLUME HAVING WITHIN IT AN ARMORIAL BOOKPLATEHAPPENED TO BE FOUND IN WRONGFUL CUSTODY THE FINDER MIGHT RECOGNISE THEHERALDRY OF THE OWNER EVEN IF HE COULD NOT READ THE INSCRIPTIONRECORDING THAT OWNERSHIP.SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY USE OF BOOKPLATES IN ENGLAND. IN THE NEXT CHAPTERI PROPOSE TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE LEADING STYLES OF DECORATIONEMPLOYED BY THEIR DESIGNERS.FOOTNOTES THERE ARE TWO SIZES OF THIS BOOKPLATE. REPORT BY THE HISTORICAL MSS. COMMISSION ON THE PAPERS OF THE DUKEOF RUTLAND.CHAPTER IIISTYLES IN ENGLISH BOOKPLATESLORD DE TABLEY HAS GIVEN US NAMES FOR NEARLY ALL THE STYLES MET WITH INENGLISH BOOKPLATES AND IT IS PERHAPS BETTER TO ACCEPT THESEDESCRIPTIONS IN THE PRESENT WORK ADDING TO THEM ANOTHERSIMPLEARMORIALFOR THE EARLIEST PLATES AND INDEED FOR THE GREAT MAJORITYOF THOSE ANTERIOR TO .IT IS NOT ONLY IN BOOKPLATES THAT WE SEE THIS STYLE ADOPTED IT IS USEDIN ALMOST EVERY REPRESENTATION OF SHIELDS OF ARMS IN THE SIXTEENTH ANDSEVENTEENTH CENTURIES BE IT ON A MEMORIAL BRASS IN SCULPTURE OR ON ASTAINED GLASS WINDOW. THE STYLE IS SIMPLE AND EFFECTIVE. THE SHIELDNEARLY ALWAYS SYMMETRICAL IS SURMOUNTED BY A HELMET ON WHICH IS THEWREATH AND CREST. FROM THE HELMET IS OUTSPREAD MORE OR LESS VOLUMINOUSMANTLING. IN THE EARLIER EXAMPLES THIS TERMINATES GENERALLY IN TASSELSBEFORE REACHING THE BASE OF THE SHIELD. IN LATER EXAMPLES ITS HEAVYFOLDS DESCEND QUITE TO THE BASE AND OFTEN ASCEND UPWARDS FROM THEHELMET TO THE LEVEL OF THE TOP OF THE CREST. BELOW THE SHIELD IS ANARROW SCROLL FOR THE MOTTO WHICH IS NOT ALWAYS GIVEN AND AT THEBOTTOM OF ALL IS A BRACKET ON WHICH THE OWNERS NAME IS INSCRIBEDHAVING INDENTED EDGES. OCCASIONALLY BUT NOT OFTEN THE MANTLINGINSTEAD OF BEING FOLIATED HANGS FROM THE HELMET IN STIFF FOLDS AT THEBACK OF THE SHIELD ITS UPPER CORNERS BEING TIED UP AND TASSELLED. THEBOOKPLATE OF THOMAS KNATCHBULL DATED IN  SHOWN ON P.  IS AVERY FAIR THOUGH NOT A VERY EARLY EXAMPLE OF THIS STYLE. IN SOMEINSTANCES THE SHIELD IS PLACED ON ONE SIDEITS RIGHT HAND UPPER CORNERBEING THUS BROUGHT TO THE CENTRE OF THE HELMET. THE SIMPLE ARMORIALSTYLE WAS ROUGHLY SPEAKING NOT MUCH USED AFTER .BESIDES THE BOOKPLATES DESCRIBED IN THE FOREGOING CHAPTER NEARLY ALLOF WHICH BELONG TO THE ARMORIAL STYLE THERE ARE SUNDRY OTHERS WORTHYOF PARTICULAR OBSERVATION SHOULD THE READER MEET WITH THEM. THERE ISFOR INSTANCE THE BOOKPLATE OF THE RIGHT HONBLE JAMES EARL OFDERBY LORD OF MAN AND YE ISLES  THE GRANDSON OF THE JAMESSEVENTH EARL WHO SUFFERED FOR HIS LOYALTY AND OF THE GALLANT CHARLOTTETRMOUILLE. THIS IS A LARGE AND VERY STRIKING BOOKPLATE IN EVERY WAYITS SIZE MAKES POSSIBLE THE INTRODUCTION OF SOME FINE BOLD WORK WHICHIS RENDERED EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE BY THE FACT THAT THE ARMS PORTRAYED ARESIMPLY THOSE OF STANLEY SO THAT THERE IS NO CROWDING IN OF QUARTERINGS.THE DECORATION IS THAT COMMON TO THE BOOKPLATES OF PEERS OR OF OTHERPERSONS ENTITLED TO USE SUPPORTERS AT THE TIME THE MANTLING SPREADSFROM THE HELMET AND TERMINATES AT THE HEADS OF THE SUPPORTERS THESESTAND UPON THE MOTTOSCROLL. THERE IS A SMALLER VARIETY OF THISBOOKPLATEONE OF THE ORDINARY SIZEWHICH IS NOT SO PLEASING. WHENEARL JAMES DIED IN  THE EARLDOM OF DERBY DEVOLVED ON HIS KINSMANSIR EDWARD STANLEY BART. WHOSE BOOKPLATE LARGER AND FINER THAN THATJUST DESCRIBED IS REALLY A VERY BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF WORK IN THE JACOBEANSTYLE THE ARMS ARE STANLEY IMPALING HESKETH AND THE SIZE OF THEBOOKPLATE IS    IN.SIMILAR EXAMPLES OF LARGESIZED BOOKPLATES ARE FURNISHED BY THOSE OFTHE HONOURABLE IAMES BRYDGES OF WILTON CASTLE IN HEREFORD SHEREWHERE THE EFFECT IS SOMEWHAT MARRED BY THE NUMBER OF QUARTERINGSDISPLAYED SIR WILLIAM BROWNLOWE OF BELTON IN THE COUNTY OF LINCOLNBARONET  AND HIS WIFE DAME ALICE BROWNLOWE LORD ROOS AND HISWIFE LADY ROOS PAUL JODRELL OF DUFFIELD IN YE COUNTY OF DERBYESQR CLERK OF YE HONBLE HOUSE OF COMMONSA PARTICULARLY BOLDPIECE OF WORK AND SR JOHN WENTWORTH OF NORTH ELMESHALL IN THE WESTRIDEING OF YORKSHIRE BARONET. IT IS PROBABLE THAT ALL THESE AND OTHERLARGESIZED ENGLISH BOOKPLATES ALSO EXIST OR EXISTED IN THE ORDINARYSIZE SEE PP.  . THE LARGEST ENGLISH BOOKPLATE AND ONE WHICHFROM ITS UNUSUAL SIZE IS CERTAIN TO ATTRACT ATTENTION IS THAT OFSIMON SCROOPE OF DANBYSUPERYORE IN COM. EBOR. ESQ.  HERETOO MUCH OF THE GOOD EFFECT IS LOST BY THE NUMBER OF QUARTERINGS NOLESS THAN TWENTYSEVEN INTRODUCED UPON THE SHIELD.ILLUSTRATIONI REFERRED AT THE CLOSE OF THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER TO THE LARGE NUMBER OFENGLISH BOOKPLATES ENGRAVED DURING THE LAST TWO YEARS OF THESEVENTEENTH CENTURY AND FIRST TEN OF THE EIGHTEENTH. THE GREAT MAJORITYOF THESE BOOKPLATES ARE IN THE SIMPLE ARMORIAL STYLE AND THERE ISUPON THESE A VERY GREAT SIMILARITY IN THE WAY IN WHICH THAT STYLE ISREPRESENTED INDEED THEY MAY WELL HAVE BEEN ALL OF THEM THE WORK OFLESS THAN A DOZEN ARTISTS. ANY DISTINCTIVE FEATURE THAT EXISTS IS TO BEFOUND IN THE TREATMENT OF THE MANTLING. FOR INSTANCE IT IS FINELY CUTON THE BOOKPLATES OF NICHOLAS PENNY LORD CORNWALLIS LORD ROOS ANDJOHN SAYER OF HOUNSLOW IN THE COUNTY OF MIDD. ESQR ALL DATED IN ON THE SAYER PLATE THE INSCRIPTION IS ENCLOSED IN A JACOBEANSCROLL IT IS HEAVY AND STIFFLY CUT IN THE BOOKPLATES OF JAMESBENGOUGH RICHARD NEWDIGATE SIR WILLIAM HUSTLER AND JOHN GODFREY ALLDATED IN  IT IS LEAFLIKE AND GRACEFUL ON THE BOOKPLATES OF WILLIAMTHOMPSON AND FRANCIS COLUMBINE DATED IN  AND OF THOMAS ROWNEYDATED IN  WHILST THE BOOKPLATE OF GOSTLET HARINGTON OFMARSHFIELD IN THE COUN. OF GLOCESTER GENT.  IS UNIQUE THEMANTLING BEING CUT LIKE STRAWBERRY LEAVES. THERE IS A PECULIAR EFFECTPRODUCED BY THE WAY IN WHICH THIS EXAMPLE IS PRINTED AND THE LETTERINGOF THE INSCRIPTION IS ALSO UNUSUAL.THERE IS ONE OF THESE BOOKPLATES WHICH THE READER SHOULD NOTICE FROMTHE PECULIAR ARRANGEMENT OF THE DECORATIVE ACCESSORIES OCCASIONED BYTHE FACT THAT THE OWNER WAS BOTH A SPIRITUAL AND TEMPORAL PEER. I REFERTO THAT OF NATHANAEL CREWE LORD BISHOP OF DURHAM AND BARON CREWE OFSTENE . HERE THE MANTLING SPRINGS FROM THE HELMET RISES TO THELEVEL OF THE CREST AND TERMINATES AT THE HEADS OF THE SUPPORTERS ABARONS CORONET APPEARS INSTEAD OF A MITRE AND BEHIND THE SHIELD ARE ACROZIER AND SWORD IN SALTIRE THE DECORATION OF THE HEAD OF THE CROZIERBEING SO LIKE THE FORM OF THE MANTLING THAT IT SEEMS AT FIRST SIGHT TOBE PART OF IT.THE JACOBEAN STYLE IS FAR MORE ORNATE THAN THAT LAST MENTIONED ANDTHE BOOKPLATE OF JOHN REILLY OF THE MIDDLE TEMPLE ESQR. IS A FAIREXAMPLE OF THE BEST KIND OF JACOBEAN WORK. THE ESCUTCHEON IS RAISED ONAN ELABORATE AND RICHLYCARVED JACOBEAN SIDEBOARD MANTLING IS STILLTHERE BUT IT IS CURTAILED AND SEEMS ALMOST RESTING ON THE TOP OF THESIDEBOARD ON EITHER SIDE OF WHICH ARE COLUMNS GIVEN IN HIGH RELIEF ONEACH IS CARVED A PERPENDICULAR FESTOON OF LEAVES. BELOW THE SHIELDCROUCHED ON THE LEDGE OF THE SIDEBOARD ARE TWO EAGLES WITH EXPANDEDWINGS EACH HOLDS IN ITS BEAK ONE END OF THE RIBBON WHICH TIES INTO ABUNCH THE CORNERS OF A FRINGED CLOTH BEARING THE INSCRIPTION ALREADYQUOTED BELOW THE EAGLES INVERTED CORNUCOPI POUR OUT BOOKS UPON THEFLOOR ON WHICH THE SIDEBOARD STANDS.THIS PLATE MAY PROBABLY BE DATED VERY EARLY IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURYOR EVEN LATE IN THE SEVENTEENTH SINCE IT IS RECORDED THAT JOHN REILLYSSIGNATURE WITH THE DATE  OCCURS IN A BOOK IN WHICH IT ISFASTENED. TO WHICHEVER DATE IT BELONGS THE SIMPLE ARMORIAL STYLE WASTHEN IN GENERAL USETHAT IS TO SAY SO FAR AS THE BOOKPLATES OFPRIVATE INDIVIDUALS ARE CONCERNED. THESE AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN NEARLYALL BEAR A HELMET VARYING ACCORDING TO THE OWNERS SOCIAL RANK ANDFROM THAT FALLS THE MANTLING MORE OR LESS ELABORATE. BUT IF WE LOOK ATTHE BOOKPLATES DATED IN OR ABOUT THE YEAR  OF CERTAIN COLLEGES ATOXFORD OR CAMBRIDGE AT LADIES BOOKPLATES OF THE SAME PERIODNONE OFWHICH OF COURSE DISPLAY A HELMETAND AT SOME OTHERS IN WHICH THEARMS ARE GIVEN IN AN OVAL WE SEE THAT THE BLANK ON EITHER SIDE OF THESHIELD CONSEQUENT UPON THE ABSENCE OF THE HELMET FROM WHICH THEMANTLING WOULD FALL IS SUPPLIED BY WORK DISTINCTLY JACOBEAN. LORD DETABLEY WHOSE DESCRIPTIONS IN JUSTIFICATION OF THE NAMES HE HAS BESTOWEDUPON THE SEVERAL STYLES WE SHALL NOT HESITATE TO QUOTE IN THIS CHAPTERTHUS DESCRIBES THIS WORKTO SUPPLY THIS VOID IN DECORATION A DISTINCT FRAME WAS PLACED ROUNDTHE ESCUTCHEONS AND THIS FRAMEWORK WAS ORNAMENTED WITH RIBBONS PALMBRANCHES OR FESTOONS.THE PROMINENT OR HIGHRELIEF PORTIONS OF THIS FRAME WERE NOT SET CLOSETO THE EDGES OF THE ESCUTCHEONS BUT BETWEEN IT AND THEM AN INTERVAL OFFLATPATTERNED SURFACE NEARLY ALWAYS INTERVENED IN WHICH AS UPON AWALL THE ACTUAL SHIELD WAS EMBEDDED. THIS WE SHALL CALL THE LINING OFTHE ARMORIAL FRAME AND WE SHALL FIND THIS LINING IS USUALLY IMBRICATEDWITH A PATTERN OF FISHSCALES ONE UPON ANOTHER OR DIAPERED INTOLATTICEWORK. THE SCALECOVERED OR LATTICED INTERVAL OF LINING IS THECHARACTERISTIC OF THE STYLE. . . . ANOTHER STEP IN THE EXTERNALDECORATION WAS TO ADD A BRACKET DISTINCT FROM THE FRAME UPON WHICH THESHIELD IN ITS FRAME WAS SUPPOSED TO REST. THIS BRACKET NATURALLYINITIATED THE DECORATIVE ART AND SURFACE ARRANGEMENT OF THESHIELDFRAME.AS A RULE TOO AN ESCALLOPSHELL FORMS THE CENTRE OF THE BRACKET INJACOBEAN BOOKPLATES. IN SOME INSTANCES IT IS PLACED IN THE CENTREBELOW BUT MORE USUALLY IN THE CENTRE ABOVE AND THEN IN THE CENTREBELOW WE HAVE THE HEAD OF SOME MYTHICAL AND UNINVITING MONSTER. EITHERAS QUASISUPPORTERS ON THE LEDGES OF THE BRACKET RIGHT AND LEFT OR ONTHE SIDE LEDGES OF THE SHIELD IF THE BRACKET IS AMALGAMATED WITH THEFRAME ARE THINGS SELECTED FROM THE FOLLOWING MISCELLANEOUSCOLLECTIONLIONS CHERUBS MALE AND FEMALE TERMFIGURES BUSTS OFFAIRIES WITH BUTTERFLY WINGS ANGELS GENERALLY ENGAGED INTRUMPETBLOWING ETC.THE STUDENT SHOULD NOTICE THIS ESCALLOPSHELL BECAUSE WE SHALL SEE ITINTRODUCED INTO THE STYLE OF DECORATION THAT SUCCEEDED THEJACOBEANTHERE IT BECAME A SHELLY BORDER RATHER THAN A DISTINCT SHELL.ON THE WHOLE THEN THE USUAL ORNAMENTATION OF A JACOBEAN BOOKPLATERENDERS IT EASILY RECOGNISABLE. THE DECORATION IS STIFF ANDCONVENTIONAL DISPLAYS MORE SOLIDITY THAN GRACE AND ALTOGETHER SEEMSLESS APPROPRIATE TO A BOOKPLATE THAN THE HEAVY ROLLS OF MANTLINGWHICH AS WE HAVE SEEN SURROUNDED THE SHIELD DURING THE PREVALENCE OFTHE PRECEDING STYLE. AS FOR THE TITLE JACOBEAN WHICH HAS BEEN BESTOWEDUPON IT IT SHOULD BE EXPLAINED THAT THE REFERENCE IS RATHER TO THESTYLE OF DECORATION IN VOGUE IN THE DAYS OF JAMES II. THAN TO ANYTHINGIN THE DAYS OF JAMES I. LORD DE TABLEY HAS POINTED OUT THAT AS COMPAREDWITH THE WOODWORK PRESERVED IN CHURCHES OF THE LATTER HALF OF THESEVENTEENTH CENTURY AND AS COMPARED WITH THE MOULDINGS ON MONUMENTS OFTHE SAME PERIOD A PRACTICAL IDENTITY OF DECORATION CANNOT FAIL TOSTRIKE THE ANTIQUARY AND HIS CHOICE OF THE NAME JACOBEAN FOR THISCLASS OF BOOKPLATES IS THUS ABUNDANTLY JUSTIFIED.EXAMPLES OF JACOBEAN BOOKPLATES ARE NUMEROUS IN MOST ENGLISHCOLLECTIONS FOR THE STYLE CONTINUED LONG IN FASHION INDEED IT LASTEDIN MORE OR LESS PURITY DOWN TO  OR EVEN LATER AND I THINK ITQUITE LIKELY THAT SOME OF THE EVIDENTLY EARLY UNDATED EXAMPLES MAYREALLY HAVE BEEN EXECUTED DURING THE LAST QUARTER OF THE SEVENTEENTHCENTURY. THE SIMILARITY TO WHICH WE HAVE JUST ALLUDED BETWEEN THEORNAMENTATION SHOWN UPON JACOBEAN BOOKPLATES AND THAT DISPLAYED INECCLESIASTICAL DECORATION OF THE TIME OF CHARLES THE SECOND AS WELL ASJAMES THE SECOND MAKES IT VERY PROBABLE THAT THIS IS SO.THE FEW BOOKPLATES WHICH ARE KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN DESIGNED OR EXECUTED BYHOGARTH SEE P.  ARE IN THE JACOBEAN STYLE BUT WITH THE EXCEPTIONOF THAT EMINENT ARTIST AND GEORGE VERTUE THE MEN WHO WORKED UPONJACOBEAN BOOKPLATES WERE NOT DISTINGUISHED ENGRAVERS. NEVERTHELESSSOME OF THEIR PRODUCTIONS ARE DISTINCTLY GOOD THOUGH THE DECORATIONWAS PERHAPS TOO OFTEN OVERDONE. THE TOUCH IN MANY SUGGESTS THAT THEARTIST WAS ACCUSTOMED TO ENGRAVE ON GOLD OR SILVER PLATE. THIS ISNOTABLY THE CASE IN THE BOOKPLATE OF CHARLES BARLOW ESQ. OF EMMANUELCOLLEGE CAMBRIDGE ENGRAVED IN OR IMMEDIATELY AFTER . THISBOOKPLATE IS WORTHY OF OBSERVATION SHOULD THE READER MEET WITH IT ASA PARTICULARLY EXAGGERATED EXAMPLE OF THE JACOBEAN STYLE THE FRAMEWORKSEEMS SCARCELY ABLE TO SUPPORT THE DECORATIVE ACCESSORIES WITH WHICH ITIS LADEN AND WHICH INCLUDE REPRESENTATIONS OF BIRDS BEASTS MYTHICALFIGURES STONY FLOWERS IN FESTOONS OR BASKETS HEADS SHELLS AND WHATNOTTHE EARLIEST DATED JACOBEAN EXAMPLE IS THAT OF WILLIAM FITZ GERALDLORD BISHOP OF CLONFERT WHICH IS INSCRIBED . HERE THE ESCUTCHEONIS OF THE SIMPLE ARMORIAL SHAPE BUT SET IN A JACOBEAN FRAMEWORKDECORATED WITH LEAFY SPRAYS AND SURMOUNTED BY A MITRE THE RIBBONS OFWHICH TERMINATE IN TASSELS. NEXT WE HAVE THE BOOKPLATES OF FIVECAMBRIDGE COLLEGESJESUS PEMBROKE QUEENS ST. JOHNS AND TRINITYHALL ALL BEAR THE SAME ENGRAVED DATE. THESE AND MANY LIKE THEMDATED IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS ARE NO DOUBT THE WORK OF ONE MAN THE DESIGNCONSISTS OF AN ESCUTCHEON ON WHICH ARE THE COLLEGE ARMS SET IN AFINELYDRAWN SCALEPATTERNED FRAME BEDECKED WITH HAWKBELLS RIBBONSWREATHS AND SPRAYS OF FLOWERS. OTHER COLLEGE PLATESEXCEPT THAT OF NEWCOLLEGE OXFORD WHICH IS SIMPLE ARMORIAL IN ITS STYLEARE JACOBEAN.IN  COMES THE BOOKPLATE OF DAME ANNA MARGARETTA MASON. HERE THELOZENGE IN WHICH SHE BEARS HER ARMS APPEARS WITH DECORATION VERYSIMILAR TO THAT JUST DESCRIBED THOUGH SLIGHTLY MORE ELABORATE. IN THE BOOKPLATE OF PHILIP LYNCH SHOWS HOW SIMILAR DECORATION IS BESTOWEDUPON AN OVAL ESCUTCHEON WHILST IN  THE BOOKPLATE OF HENRY DUKEOF KENT FURNISHES AN EARLY DATED EXAMPLE OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THEBRACKET WHICH IS AS WE HAVE SEEN A LEADING FEATURE IN JACOBEANORNAMENTATION.THIS IS REALLY A REMARKABLY FINE BOOKPLATE. THE ESCUTCHEON INDENTED INA SOMEWHAT PECULIAR FASHION IS SURROUNDED BY THE GARTER AND FASTENEDTO THE FRONT OF THE BRACKET A HIGHLY ORNAMENTED PIECE OF WORK ON WHICHSTAND THE TWO SUPPORTERS. ABOVE IS THE DUCAL CORONET BELOW IN ANOBLONG JACOBEAN FRAME IS THE INSCRIPTION. THE FAMILY OF GREY DUKES OFKENT IS PROLIFIC IN BOOKPLATES THAT DATED FIVE YEARS LATER OFMARY COUNTESS OF HARROLD DAUGHTERINLAW TO HENRY DUKE OF KENT ISA MORE ELABORATE THOUGH LESS FINELY EXECUTED PIECE OF JACOBEAN WORK.HER ARMS AND THOSE OF HER HUSBAND APPEAR SIDE BY SIDE IN SEPARATE OVALSHIELDS ANGELS HOLD ALOFT AN EARLS CORONET OVER BOTH WHILE BELOWBETWEEN THE SHIELDS IS THE HEAD OF A CHERUB WHOSE WINGS ARE ARRANGEDAS A COLLAR.OTHER CONSPICUOUS JACOBEAN BOOKPLATES ARE THOSE OF ELLERKER BRADSHAWDR. PHILIP BISSE BISHOP OF ST. DAVIDS RICHARD MASSIE OF CODDINGTONCHESHIRE JAMES HUSTLER  SIR THOMAS HARE BARONET OF STOWHALL IN NORFOLK DATED IN  SEE P.  FRANCIS WINNINGTON OFLINCOLNS INN ESQ. DATED IN  SAML. GOODFORD OF YE INNER TEMPLEESQ. DATED IN  JOHN ROBINSON M.D. DATED IN  ST.THOMASS HOSPITAL LIBRARY AND LUCIUS HENRY HIBBINS OF GRAYS INNEESQE.A LITTLE BEFORE AND A LITTLE AFTER  THERE WAS A FASHION IN ENGLISHBOOKPLATES WHICH MAY ALMOST BE CALLED A STYLE IT WAS TO PLACE THESHIELD OF ARMS IN A MEDALLION THE BACKGROUND OF WHICH IS SHADED.BENEATH IS THE OWNERS NAME AND DESCRIPTION. THE TERM TOMBSTONE STYLEMIGHT NOT SOUND AN AGREEABLE DESIGNATION FOR THESE BOOKPLATES BUT ITWOULD BE VERY ACCURATE FOR REALLY THERE IS A STRONG LIKENESS BETWEENTHEM AND THE MONUMENTAL SLABS PLACED OVER DECEASED PERSONS WHOSE SOCIALSTATUS RENDERED THEM ELIGIBLE FOR INTERMENT IN POSITIONS WHERE THEYWOULD BE WALKED OVER BY FUTURE GENERATIONS OF CHURCHGOERS. WE MAYMENTION THREE SUCH BOOKPLATES EDWARD HAISTWELL DATED IN  SIRJOHN RUSHOUT AND JOHN LETHIEULLIER REMEMBRANCER OF THE CITY.SO FAR THE SHAPE OF THE SHIELD USED HAS BEEN PERFECTLY SYMMETRICAL. WENOW COME TO SPEAK OF THE THIRD STYLE ADOPTED BY ENGLISH BOOKPLATEDESIGNERS THE LEADING FEATURE OF WHICH IS AN ABSENCE OF SYMMETRY. THISSTYLE HAS BEEN CHRISTENED CHIPPENDALE AND WHEN ITS CHARACTERISTICSHAVE BEEN DESCRIBED AND THE LEADING FEATURES IN CHIPPENDALE FURNITUREREMEMBERED WE SHALL SEE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE NAME.THE MARK AND STAMP OF A CHIPPENDALE EX LIBRIS SAYS LORD DE TABLEYIS A FRILLING OR BORDER OF OPEN SHELLWORK SET CLOSE UP TO THE ROUNDEDOUTER MARGIN OF THE ESCUTCHEON AND WITH BREAKS MORE OR LESS ENCLOSINGIT. THIS SEEMS TO BE A MODIFICATION OF THE SCALLOP SHELL SO NORMAL ATTHE BASE EITHER OF FRAME OR BRACKET ON A JACOBEAN PLATE. IT IS IN FACTA BORDER IMITATING THE PECTINATED CURVES AND GROOVES ON THE MARGINS OF ASCALLOPSHELL. OUTSIDE THIS SUCCEED VARIOUS FURNITURELIKE LIMBS ANDFLOURISHES EMINENTLY RESEMBLING THE TRIUMPHS OF ORNATE UPHOLSTERY WHICHCHIPPENDALE ABOUT THIS TIME BROUGHT INTO VOGUE. THE HELMET AND MANTLINGARE QUITE EXCEPTIONAL IN BOOKPLATES OF THIS STYLE EXCEPT IN EXAMPLESWHICH WERE PROBABLY DESIGNED AND EXECUTED BY SCOTCH ARTISTS.ILLUSTRATIONALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT UNTIL  THAT CHIPPENDALE PUBLISHED IN FOLIOTHE GENTLEMANS AND CABINETMAKERS DIRECTOR BEING A LARGE COLLECTIONOF THE MOST USEFUL DESIGNS OF HOUSEHOLD FURNITURE IN THE MOSTFASHIONABLE TASTE WITH  PLATES OF ELEGANT DESIGNED FURNITURE THEREWAS PROBABLY BY THAT TIME A GOOD DEAL OF CHIPPENDALE FURNITURE ALREADYIN THE MARKET AND WE ARE THEREFORE NOT SURPRISED TO FIND A BOOKPLATEDESIGNED IN THE CHIPPENDALE STYLE DATED IN THAT OF EASTAPTHORPE. TRUE THE STYLE THERE SHOWN IS NOT AT ALL ADVANCED YETTHERE ARE DECIDED INDICATIONS OF IT AND FOR THAT REASON IT DESERVESATTENTION. ALTHOUGH THE SHIELD IS SHELLSHAPED AND ORNAMENTED WITHFLOWERS YET THERE ARE UPON THE PLATE INDICATIONS OF A HORIZONTALLYHATCHEDJACOBEAN LINING TO THE FRAME. WE MAY I THINK CONSIDER THIS ONE OF THEEARLIEST ATTEMPTS AT DESIGNING A CHIPPENDALE BOOKPLATE.ILLUSTRATIONTHE STYLE IMPROVED DURING THE NEXT TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS AND THEN BEGANTO DETERIORATE. AS AN ESCUTCHEON THE SHELLSHAPED OR NONSYMMETRICALSHIELD IS UNNATURAL AND EVEN UGLY BUT IT LENDS ITSELF TO AN ARTISTICTREATMENT WHICH THE PREVIOUS STYLES IN ENGLISH BOOKPLATES CERTAINLY DIDNOT. FOR EXAMPLE FLOWERSOF WHICH THERE ARE ALWAYS MANY IN THIS STYLEOF BOOKPLATECAN BE REPRESENTED AS IN NATURE ROSES BLOSSOM ON SPRAYSOR BRANCHES INSTEAD OF BEING WOVEN CLOSELY TOGETHER IN CONVENTIONALFESTOONS LILIES ARE LEFT TO DROOP THEIR HEADS WHILST BUNCHES OFGRASSES OR LEAVES ARE BOUND SO LOOSELY TOGETHER THAT THEY FORFEITNOTHING OF THEIR NATURAL ELEGANCE. ALLEGORIC FIGURES ALSO FIND PLACE INCHIPPENDALE BOOKPLATES BUT THEY ARE OF A MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE KINDTHAN THOSE DISPLAYED IN THE JACOBEAN PLATES. CUPIDS OR NYMPHS ARESOMETIMES REALLY GRACEFUL BITS OF DRAWING WHEN DEPICTED IN THE BETTERSPECIMENS OF THE STYLE OF WHICH WE ARE NOW SPEAKING. THE BOOKPLATE OFJAMES BRACKSTONE CITIZEN OF LONDON DATED IN FIGURED OPPOSITETHIS PAGEIS AS GOOD A SPECIMEN OF A PURE CHIPPENDALE BOOKPLATE ASCOULD BE FOUND WHILST THAT OF JOHN ORD OF LINCOLN INN DATED TENYEARS LATER BETRAYS SOME SIGNS OF A DECADENCE WHICH SOON AFTERWARDSBECAME GENERAL.THE FASHION AS LORD DE TABLEY REMARKS BEGAN TO BE VULGARISED IN THEHANDS OF WEAK DESIGNERS WHO BESTOWED FLORAL EMBELLISHMENTS UPON THEFRAMEWORK OF THE SHIELDS WITHOUT ANY MODERATION WHATEVER ENDEAVOURINGBY A CROWDED DECORATION TO MASK THE REAL WEAKNESS AND POVERTY OF THEIRPOWERS OF DESIGN. AS A CONSEQUENCE WE HAVE IN THE LATER CHIPPENDALEBOOKPLATES THOSE SAY FROM  TO  OR  SOME VERY TERRIBLEPRODUCTIONS. SHELLWORK AND FLOWERS ARE RETAINED BUT THEY ARE REGARDEDAS INADEQUATE AND CHERUBS DRAGONS NYMPHS IN KILTED PETTICOATSSHEEP CATTLE TREES FRUIT FRUITBASKETS PORTIONS OF BUILDINGSFOUNTAINS BOOKS IMPLEMENTS OF HUSBANDRY AND A HOST OF OTHERMISCELLANEOUS OBJECTS APPEAR AS DECORATIONS. INDEED IT IS WONDERFULWHAT A STRANGE MEDLEY A DESIGNER IN THE LATER DAYS OF CHIPPENDALEISMCOULD PRODUCE FOR A CUSTOMER WILLING TO PAY FOR ITWE MAY AS WELL HERE POINT OUT A FEW INTERESTING EXAMPLES OF ENGLISHBOOKPLATES DESIGNED IN THE CHIPPENDALE STYLE. A PROLIFIC WORKER IN ITWAS J. SKINNER OF BATH SEE PP.   WHO FOLLOWED THEEXCELLENT PLAN OF DATING NEARLY ALL HIS WORK WHICH SHOULD THEREFOREBE CAREFULLY OBSERVED WHEN MET WITH. IN ONE OF HIS BOOKPLATES THATWHICH IN  HE PRODUCED FOR CHARLES DELAFAYE ESQ. OF WICHBURYWILTS. IT IS CURIOUS TO NOTE WITH WHAT EVIDENT DIFFIDENCE THE DESIGNERUSES THE GRACEFUL SPRAYS OF NATURAL FLOWERS IN ORNAMENTING THE SHELLYSHIELD. YET IN ANOTHER BOOKPLATE THAT OF BENJAMIN HATLEY FOOTEENGRAVED IN THE SAME YEAR THE ANONYMOUS ARTIST USES THESE ORNAMENTSWITHOUT HESITATION AND PRODUCES A BOOKPLATE WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEENENGRAVED MANY YEARS LATER. TWO VERY NOTICEABLE EXAMPLES ARE ALSOSUPPLIED BY THE FULLY DEVELOPED CHIPPENDALE BOOKPLATES OF RICHARDCARYER AND JOSEPH POCKLINGTON. IN EACH THE CREST IS PLACED ON AMINIATURE REPRESENTATION OF THE SHIELD WHICH CONTAINS THE ARMS. OF THEDEBASED CHIPPENDALE BOOKPLATES OF WHICH WE HAVE HAD TO SPEAK IT ISHARD TO SELECT EXAMPLES FOR PARTICULAR REFERENCE FOR THEY ARE SADLYNUMEROUS AND SEEM TO VIE WITH EACH OTHER IN UGLINESS AND VULGARITY THEPRIZE MAY HOWEVER BE CLAIMED BY C. EVE WHO CONSCIOUS PERHAPS OFTHE ATROCITY HE WAS COMMITTING IN USING SUCH A BOOKPLATE MAKES ANATTEMPT AT DISGUISING HIS NAME. TO DESCRIBE HIS PLATE IS NEARLYIMPOSSIBLE SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT BUILT ON TO THE FRAME ARE SUNDRYSTAGES ON WHICH A VARIETY OF PASTORAL SCENES ARE DEPICTED AND THAT ANYBEAUTIES WHICH THE FLORAL EMBELLISHMENTS MIGHT IN THEMSELVES POSSESS AREEFFECTUALLY OBLITERATED BY OVERCROWDING.BEFORE CHIPPENDALEISM HAD DIED OUT ANOTHER MARKED STYLE IN ENGLISHBOOKPLATES HAD ALREADY COME IN AND WAS GETTING TO BE GENERALLYADOPTED. WE WILL CALL THIS THE WREATH AND RIBBON OR FESTOON STYLEAND PROBABLY ONE OF THE EARLIEST EXAMPLES OF IT IS THAT FIGUREDOPPOSITE WHICH SHOWS US THE BOOKPLATE OF GEORGE LEWIS JONES BISHOP OFKILMORE DATED IN . THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF GRACE IN THESE WREATHAND RIBBON BOOKPLATES. THE SHIELD IS AGAIN SYMMETRICAL AND OF A SHAPETHAT A SHIELD MIGHT POSSIBLY BE THE FLOWERS AND LEAVES THAT DECORATE ITARE FOR THE MOST PART STILL LEFT FREE AND UNCONFINED AND EVEN WHENWOVEN INTO FESTOONS THEY ARE SOMEWHAT LESS CONVENTIONAL THAN THOSE WHICHCOMPOSE THE FESTOONS OF THE JACOBEAN PERIOD. THESE FESTOONS AND ALABYRINTH OF FLOATING RIBBONS WERE INTENDED TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LOSSOF THE SHELLY BORDER AND ITS ADJUNCTS OF THE CHIPPENDALE STYLE.JUST IN THE SAME WAY AS THE CHIPPENDALE BOOKPLATES VERY CLOSELYRESEMBLED IN THEIR DECORATION THE FURNITURE WITH WHICH CHIPPENDALEFILLED THE FASHIONABLE DRAWINGROOMS OF HIS TIME SO IN THEIR TURN THOSEDESIGNED IN WHAT WE HAVE CHRISTENED THE WREATH AND RIBBON STYLE VERYCLOSELY RESEMBLED THE DECORATION WHICH THOMAS SHERATON SUGGESTED FORCONTEMPORARY FURNITURE. THIS THE READER MAY SEE FOR HIMSELF IF HE WILLTURN TO SHERATONS WORK THE CABINETMAKER AND UPHOLSTERERS DRAWINGBOOK.ILLUSTRATIONI DO NOT KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES OF THE WREATH AND RIBBONBOOKPLATES WHICH CALL FOR SPECIAL ATTENTION. THOUGH SEVERAL ARE PRETTYTHERE IS A STRONG FAMILY LIKENESS BETWEEN ALL. PERHAPS THE MOSTCONSPICUOUS IS THAT OF JOHN SYMONS ESQR. IN THIS PRETTILY DRAWNCHERUBS DESCENDING FROM THE SKY HOLD THE CORNERS OF A MANTLE WHICHSURROUNDS THE SHIELD. THE BOOKPLATES OF SIR THOMAS BANKS IANSON OFCORFE CASTLE DORSET OF THE REV. GEORGE POLLEN AND OF JOHNHOLCOMBE NEW CROSS ARE USEFUL FOR COMPARISON ON ACCOUNT OF THEENGRAVED DATES WHICH THEY BEAR  AND  RESPECTIVELYWHILST THAT OF ROBERT SURTEES MAINSFORTH IS INTERESTING BOTH FROMITS POSSESSOR THE HISTORIAN OF DURHAM WHO WAS ALSO ITS DESIGNER ANDFROM ITS UNUSUAL HATCHED BACKGROUND.BY DEGREES THE FESTOONS OF FLOWERS AND ENTANGLEMENT OF RIBBONS WEREDISCARDED AND THE SHIELD SIMILARLY SHAPED APPEARED DESTITUTE OFORNAMENTATION. THE HELMET WAS OMITTED AND THE WREATH ON WHICH THECREST SHOULD PROPERLY REST WAS PLACED IN A MEANINGLESS WAY THEFRACTION OF AN INCH ABOVE THE UPPER LINE OF THE SHIELD AND ENTIRELYWITHOUT SUPPORT. AFTER THIS QUITE EARLY IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY ANDDURING ITS FIRST FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS THERE CAME INTO FASHION ADESIGN IN ENGLISH BOOKPLATES WHICH WE MAY TERM THE CELESTIAL STYLE.IN THIS THE SHIELD IS DEPICTED AS SUSPENDED IN MIDAIR WITH ABACKGROUND OF SKY OR CLOUDS OR ELSE RESTING UPON A CLOUDBUILT BANK. ITGAVE THE DESIGNER VERY SLIGHT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE DISPLAY OF ARTISTICTASTE HAD IT DONE SO THE OPPORTUNITY WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEENNEGLECTED FOR THE DESIGNERS AND ENGRAVERS OF BOOKPLATES IN THIS STYLEWERE MEN OF WHOM THE WORLD AT LARGE KNOWS NOTHING. THE SHIELD INBOOKPLATES OF THE TIME OF WHICH I AM NOW SPEAKING WAS ENTIRELYWITHOUT ORNAMENT AND OF THIS SHAPEILLUSTRATIONTHE HELMET WAS SELDOM INTRODUCED SO THAT THE CREST WAS PLACED IN THESAME ABSURD POSITION AS THAT JUST DESCRIBED. THE SHIELD FIGURED ABOVE ISA FAIR SPECIMEN OF THAT IN VOGUE BETWEEN  AND . FROM THE LATTERDATE TO WITHIN A FEW YEARS AGO THE ARMS IN THE MAJORITY OF ENGLISHBOOKPLATES WERE REPRESENTED IN A MORE ORNATE SHIELD. THE HELMET WASREINTRODUCED AND FROM IT FELL A SLIGHT MANTLING SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TOTHAT WHICH APPEARS IN OUR EARLIEST EXAMPLES. IT IS HARDLY NECESSARY TOINDICATE ANY PARTICULAR SPECIMENS DESIGNED IN THESE LASTMENTIONEDSTYLES.BEFORE CLOSING THIS CHAPTER I OUGHT PERHAPS TO SAY A WORD ABOUTSCOTCH AND IRISH BOOKPLATES. IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT IN THESE THERE WASEVER A STYLE DISTINCTIVELY NATIONAL. THE STYLE FASHIONABLE IN ENGLAND ATA PARTICULAR TIME WAS ALSO FASHIONABLE IN SCOTLAND AND IN IRELAND YETTHERE IS A PERCEPTIBLE DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY IN WHICH ITS DETAILS WERECARRIED OUT ESPECIALLY IN SCOTLAND. IN EDINBURGH THERE WERE SEVERALBOOKPLATE ENGRAVERS AND THEIR WORK POSSESSES A CHARACTERISTICTOUCH THE SIMPLE ARMORIAL STYLE IS RENDERED MUCH MORE STIFFLY ANDTHE SHIELD IS OFTEN ROUND. JACOBEAN BOOKPLATES ARE VERY UNCOMMON BUTTHE CHIPPENDALES ARE AN ODD MIXTURE OF THAT STYLE AS WE KNOW IT INENGLAND AND THE JACOBEAN. THE PRESENCE OF A HELMET AND MANTLING IN ACHIPPENDALE BOOKPLATE ENGRAVED IN SCOTLAND IS NOT UNUSUAL AND THESHIELD IS ALWAYS VERY SOBERLY PLACED. I DO NOT KNOW OF A LIBRARYINTERIOR PLATE THAT HAILS FROM NORTH OF THE TWEED BUT IF ONE EVER BEDISCOVERED DEPEND UPON IT NO CUPIDS WILL FROLIC THERE. A FEW SCOTCHBOOKPLATES ARE PERHAPS EMBLEMATIC THAT IS DISPLAY EMBLEMS OF THEPOSSESSORS ART OR TRADE. DR. JOHN BOSWORTHS IN WHICH ARE FIGURED THESTAFF OF SCULAPIUS A COCK A SERPENT AND AN OWL IS AN INSTANCE OFTHIS BUT ALLEGORY IS ALMOST UNKNOWN. NO MYTHOLOGICAL FIGURES SIT AMONGTHE FLORAL DECORATIONS OF SCOTCH CHIPPENDALE BOOKPLATES AS THEY DO SOFREQUENTLY IN LATER CHIPPENDALE WORK IN ENGLAND. THE ONLY INSTANCE THATI CAN CALL TO MIND OF THE INTRODUCTION OF FIGURES AT ALL INTO THEDECORATION OF A SCOTCH BOOKPLATE IS THAT OF BIRNIE OF BROOMHILLCIRCA  REPRODUCED OPPOSITE AND IN THIS THE FIGURES ARE SOMBREENOUGHTWO MINISTERS OF THE KIRK KNEELING AT THEIR DESKS. IRISHBOOKPLATES HAVE EVEN LESS INDIVIDUALITY THAN SCOTCH AND ARE CHIEFLYRECOGNISABLE BY THE COARSENESS OF THEIR WORK AND THEIR DARK PRINTING.ILLUSTRATIONFOOTNOTE A LIST OF SOME SCOTTISH BOOKPLATE ENGRAVERS COMPILED BY MR. J.ORR IS PRINTED IN THE EX LIBRIS JOURNAL II. P. .CHAPTER IVALLEGORY IN ENGLISH BOOKPLATESIN THE LAST CHAPTER I SPOKE OF THE LEADING STYLES FOLLOWED IN DESIGNINGENGLISH BOOKPLATES IN AS FAR AS POSSIBLE CHRONOLOGICAL SEQUENCETHOUGH THE READER WILL HAVE NOTICED THAT SUCH STYLES OVERLAPPED EACHOTHER OFTEN BY A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF YEARS. CONCURRENTLY WITH THESEDISTINCT STYLES OR WITH NEARLY ALL OF THEM THERE ARE TO BE FOUND MANYENGLISH BOOKPLATES WHICH MAY BE APPROPRIATELY CALLED PICTUREBOOKPLATES AND WHICH MAY THEMSELVES BE DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THOSEWHICH QUITE APART FROM THE HERALDRY UPON THEM SHOW THINGS UNREAL ORCOMBINATIONS OF THINGS REAL AND UNREAL AND THOSE WHICH APART FROM THEHERALDRY SHOW THINGS WHOLLY REAL. LET US SPEAK FIRST OF THE FORMER OFTHESE DIVISIONSALLEGORIC BOOKPLATES WE WILL CALL THEM.THE COLLECTOR WILL SOON DISCOVER THAT IN ENGLAND ALLEGORY FORMED AT NOPERIOD EXCEPT PERHAPS IN THE DAYS OF BARTOLOZZI AND SHERWIN A REALLYNATIONAL STYLE IN BOOKPLATES BUT RATHER AN OCCASIONAL FANCY INDULGEDIN BY A PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL HERE AND THERE. WHILST IN FRANCEBOOKPLATES ON WHICH WAS DISPLAYED ALLEGORY AND THE WILDEST ALLEGORYWERE ACTUALLY ABUNDANT IN ENGLAND THEY ARE DECIDEDLY RARE AND IT ISINDEED INTERESTING TO SEE HOW OUR ENGLISH ARTISTS SET TO WORK WHENCALLED UPON TO DESIGN THEM.SO FAR AS I AM AWARE THE EARLIEST EXAMPLE OF AN ENGLISH ALLEGORICBOOKPLATE AS YET BROUGHT TO LIGHT IS THAT OF THOMAS GORE OF ALDERTONWHICH IS FULLY DESCRIBED ON P. . THIS MAY BE DATED SOMEWHERE ABOUT AND WAS AS THE SIGNATURE SHOWS US THE WORK OF A DUTCH ARTISTMICHAEL BURGHERS SO THAT WE MAY PERHAPS REGARD THE ALLEGORY UPON ITRATHER AS THE OUTCOME OF MICHAELS BRAIN THAN THE CARRYING OUT OFINSTRUCTIONS GIVEN HIM BY A WILTSHIRE SQUIRETHE DATE OF THE NEXT ENGLISH BOOKPLATE I HAVE NOTICED IN WHICHALLEGORY IS INTRODUCED IS ALSO THE WORK OF A FOREIGNERAFRENCHMANLOUIS DU GUERNIER WHO AT THE AGE OF THIRTY CAME OVER FROMPARIS IN  AND WHO DIED HERE IN . SOON AFTER HIS ARRIVAL HEEXECUTED A BOOKPLATE DECIDEDLY FOREIGN IN APPEARANCE FOR LADYCAIRNES WIFE OF SIR ALEXANDER CAIRNES OF MONAGHAN. THE CAIRNES ARMSIMPALING GOULD ARE ON A ROUND SHIELD IN A SCALY FRAME THIS IS PLACEDON STEPS AT THE BACK OF WHICH IS CLASSICAL MASONRY. THE SHIELD IS KEPTFROM FALLING BY THREE CUPIDSTWO SEATED AND ONE STANDINGWHILST TWOFLYING ONES HOLD ALOFT A RIBBON BEARING THE OWNERS NAME THUS LADYELIZABETH CAIRNES. SHE WAS A SISTER OF SIR NATHANIEL GOULD SO THAT HERDESCRIPTION ON THE BOOKPLATE AS LADY IS CLEARLY WRONG SHE SHOULDHAVE BEEN CALLED DAME. THE ERROR AROSE MOST LIKELY FROM THEENGRAVERS IMPERFECT KNOWLEDGE OF ENGLISH TITLESA VERY GENERALSTUMBLINGBLOCK TO FOREIGNERS. THE BOOKPLATE IS AN EXCEEDINGLY PRETTYPIECE OF WORK. THERE IS SOME OF THE JACOBEAN SCALE WORK USED IN IT WHICHENGLISH ENGRAVERS WERE BEGINNING TO INTRODUCE INTO THEIR DESIGNS BUTTHE EMPLOYMENT OF ALLEGORY IS CERTAINLY THE MOST STRIKING FEATURE ITPOSSESSES. I DO NOT KNOW OF ANY OTHER BOOKPLATES EXECUTED BY LOUIS DUGUERNIER WHILE IN ENGLAND AND PROBABLY THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY WERENOT YET QUITE PREPARED TO CONFIDEAS LORD DE TABLEY PUTS ITTHEIRFAMILY ESCUTCHEONS TO THE CARE OF MINERVA OR THE DELIAN PHOEBUSHIMSELF.BUT THOUGH MICHAEL BURGHERSS SOMEWHAT UNBEAUTIFUL ALLEGORY MAY NOT HAVEPLEASED THOMAS GORE OR HIS OTHER ENGLISH CLIENTS IN  NOR THEPRETTIER ALLEGORY OF LOUIS DU GUERNIER HAVE GENERALLY COMMENDED ITSELFTO PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY IN  ALLEGORY IF NOT IN THE WORK OF THESEARTISTS WAS BOUND SOONER OR LATER TO COME INTO FASHION ON ENGLISHBOOKPLATES SEEING THAT IT WAS AND FOR LONG HAD BEEN FASHIONABLEACROSS THE CHANNEL. THERE HAVE BEEN FEW OUTBREAKS OF DISEASE ON THECONTINENT THAT HAVE NOT INFECTED THIS COUNTRYAT ALL EVENTS SLIGHTLY.THE FOREIGNERS WHOM THE FOREIGN KING ON HIS ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND IN BROUGHT WITH HIM ENGENDERED FOREIGN WAYS AND FOREIGN FASHIONS AT COURTAND THESE WAYS AND FASHIONS WERE IN TURN ADOPTED BY PEOPLE WHO DID NOTGO TO COURT AND THAT IS HOW ALLEGORY CREPT INTO THE BOOKPLATES OF THERANK AND FILE OF ENGLISHMEN.THE FIRST ENGLISH ENGRAVER BORN AND BRED TO EXECUTE AN ALLEGORICBOOKPLATE WAS JOHN PINE HIMSELF A MAN OF LETTERS AND ONE WITH WHOSEFEATURES HOGARTH HAS MADE US FAMILIAR. IN  HE WAS EMPLOYED TO DESIGNAND ENGRAVE A BOOKPLATE TO PLACE IN THE THIRTY THOUSAND VOLUMES OFBISHOP MOORES LIBRARY WHICH GEORGE I. HAD BOUGHT IN  TO PRESENTTO THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE BUT WHICH WERE NOT SUITABLY HOUSED TILL. NO DOUBT PINE WAS FULLY IMPRESSED WITH THE MUNIFICENCE OF THEGIFTA MASS OF VOLUMES WHICH THE HEAVYHEADED KING WOULD HAVE NEVEROPENED HAD HE KEPT AND NEVER UNDERSTOOD HAD HE OPENED THEM. HIS TASKWAS TO DESIGN A BOOKPLATE COMMENSURATE WITH THE ROYAL MUNIFICENCE ANDHE PROBABLY CONSIDERED HE HAD BEEN EQUAL TO THE OCCASION WHEN HEPRODUCED WHAT WE SEE OPPOSITE THE NEXT PAGE. LORD DE TABLEYS WORDS SOACCURATELY DESCRIBE THIS POMPOUS PRODUCTION THAT I WILL QUOTE THEMTHE DESIGN REPRESENTS A VAST STRUCTURE RATHER LIKE AN ORMOLUCHIMNEYPIECE CLOCK OF WHICH THE ARMS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGEIN A PLAIN SOLID FRAME REPRESENT THE FACE. BEHIND THIS TOWERS UP AVAST PYRAMID ON WHICH THE BRICK WORK IS DISTINCTLY MARKED. AS DEXTERSUPPORTER STANDS PHOEBUS APOLLO IN PERSON REACHING OUT A WREATH. ACLOUDED SUN RAYS OUT BEHIND HIM. AT HIS FEET ARE DEPOSITED SAMPLES OFTHE BOOK COLLECTION OF LATE SO MUNIFICENTLY BESTOWED. AS SINISTERSUPPORTER SITS MINERVA WITH HELM AND SPEAR AND GORGONHEADED SHIELD. HERFEET ARE WRAPT IN CLOUD.

PINEWHO HAD SUBMITTED PROOFSOF THIS BOOKPLATE BEFORE AUGUST  FOR AT THAT DATE HE OFFERS TOMAKE GEORGES PORTRAIT MORE ACCURATEENGRAVED FOUR SIZES OF THIS PLATE.THE DESIGN IS SIMILAR IN THREE BUT IN THE FOURTH AND SMALLEST THEARTIST EVIDENTLY FELT THAT IN SO LIMITED A SPACE HE COULD NOT DOJUSTICE TO APOLLO AND MINERVA AND DISCREETLY OMITTED THEM. HE SIGNSTHIS SMALLEST PLATE IN FULL J. PINE SCULP.THERE MAY NOW BE SEEN AT CAMBRIDGE IN MANY OF THE BOOKS WHICH GEORGE I.PRESENTED BOOKPLATES WHICH AT FIRST SIGHT APPEAR TO BE MODERNIMPRESSIONS FROM PINES PLATES BUT ON EXAMINATION PROVE TO BE COPIESTHOUGH NOT EXACT COPIES OF PINES WORK AND ON THESE THE SIGNATURE ISJ. B. THE LATE MR. HENRY BRADSHAW DISCOVERED THAT THESE COPIES WERETHE WORK OF JOHN BALDREY A CAMBRIDGE ENGRAVER AT THE CLOSE OF THE LASTCENTURY. AT THE TIME THAT HE WAS WORKING FOR THE UNIVERSITY A LARGENUMBER OF THE VOLUMES GIVEN BY GEORGE I. REQUIRED REBINDING AND ASPINES PLATES WERE WORN OUT OR LOST BALDREY WAS COMMISSIONED TO EXECUTEA COPY OF THE EARLIER DESIGN IN ORDER TO SUPPLY A BOOKPLATE FOR THEREBOUND VOLUMES.ILLUSTRATION BOOKPLATE FOUND IN BOOKS GIVEN BY GEORGE I. TO THEUNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE.VERY SOON AFTER THE MUNIFICENTIA REGIA TO CAMBRIDGE IN  THELOYALTY OF OXFORD TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS HOUSE OF HANOVER WAS SERIOUSLYDOUBTED AND THE KING SENT A SQUADRON OF HORSE INTO THE CITY WHEREUPONAN OXFORD VARSITY WIT COMPOSED THE FOLLOWING EPIGRAM    THE KING OBSERVING WITH JUDICIOUS EYES     THE STATE OF BOTH HIS UNIVERSITIES     TO ONE HE SENDS A REGIMENTFOR WHY     THAT LEARNED BODY WANTED LOYALTY     TO TH OTHER BOOKS HE GAVE AS WELL DISCERNING     HOW MUCH THAT LOYAL BODY WANTED LEARNING.WHICH DREW FROM A CHAMPION OF CAMBRIDGE THE REPLY    THE KING TO OXFORD SENT HIS TROOP OF HORSE     FOR TORIES OWN NO ARGUMENT BUT FORCE     WITH EQUAL CARE TO CAMBRIDGE BOOKS HE SENT     FOR WHIGS ALLOW NO FORCE BUT ARGUMENT.THOUGH MUCH LATER IN DATE THAN THE DESIGN JUST NOTICED IT MAY BE ASWELL TO MENTION HERE ANOTHER BOOKPLATEALSO ALLEGORICWHICH WASENGRAVED BY JOHN PINE. THIS WAS EXECUTED BY HIM FROM A DRAWING BYGRAVELOT FOR DR. JOHN BURTON ABOUT THE YEAR . IT SHOWS US THEINTERIOR OF A LIBRARY PRESUMABLY THE DOCTORS WITH A COUPLE OF CUPIDSSUPPORTING A SHIELD BEARING THE BURTON ARMS. THIS DESIGN WHICH WASSUBSEQUENTLY APPROPRIATED BY WADHAM WYNDHAM ESQ. AS HISBOOKPLATE IS A VERY SLIGHT AFFAIR AFTER THE CAMBRIDGE PLATE BUTPINE NO DOUBT POSSESSED A FITTING SENSE OF THE DIFFERENCE TO BE OBSERVEDIN DESIGNING A BOOKPLATE FOR A MERE DOCTOR OF DIVINITY AND INCOMMEMORATING THE GIFT OF A ROYAL DONOR.AFTER JOHN PINE THE NEXT DESIGNERS OF ENGLISH BOOKPLATES IN THEALLEGORIC STYLE ARE BOTH FAMOUS MENWILLIAM HOGARTH AND GEORGE VERTUE.WE WILL SPEAK OF THE WORKS OF THE GREATER MAN FIRST THEY CONSIST OF TWOUNDOUBTED BOOKPLATES AND OF A FEW MORE POSSIBLE ONES AND WERE EXECUTEDQUITE AT THE OUTSET OF HOGARTHS CAREER SAY ABOUT .

I HAVE ALREADY CALLED ATTENTION TOTHIS ENGRAVING IN SPEAKING OF OLDTIME ALLUSIONS TO BOOKPLATES P. AND DO NOT HERE INTEND TO DO MORE THAN MAKE PASSING REFERENCE TO ITSINCE I HAVE SPOKEN FULLY OF IT LATER ON IN WHAT I HAVE TO SAY ABOUTLADIES BOOKPLATES PP. . IT IS ONLY MENTIONED NOW IN ORDERTO GIVE A REFERENCE TO IT IN ITS PROPER CHRONOLOGICAL POSITION.WE HAVE NOW TO TRAVEL FOR SOME DISTANCE ALONG THE ROAD OF TIME BEFORECOMING TO ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF ALLEGORY ON AN ENGLISH BOOKPLATE.WE FIND IT IN  ON A PLATE WHICH ONE J. SKINNER ENGRAVED FROM ADESIGN BY T. ROSS. THIS IS REALLY A VERY BEAUTIFUL BOOKPLATE AS ITSREPRODUCTION P.  SHOWS. A SHIELDTHE SHAPE AND ORNAMENTATION OFWHICH IS CHIPPENDALEBEARING THE WILTSHIRE ARMS IS PLACED UPON APLATFORM AND AGAINST A CIPPUS OR SMALL MONUMENTAL COLUMN SHAKESPEARESTANDS ON THE RIGHT AND LISTENS WITH A PLEASED EXPRESSION TO THEMUSIC OF A RUSTIC PIPER WHOSE HEAD APPEARS AT THE BACK OF THE CIPPUSWHILST ON THE LEFT POPE WEIGHS THE ELOQUENCE OF AN ORATOR WHOSE HEADAND UPRAISED HAND ALSO APPEAR FROM BEHIND THE CIPPUS.

THEDESIGN IS CERTAINLY ORIGINAL AND MAKES US INTERESTED AS TO THE IDENTITYOF THE OWNER.IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT WE HAVE HERE NOT ONLY AN INTERESTINGBOOKPLATE BUT THE BOOKPLATE OF AN INTERESTING MAN. WHEN GAINSBOROUGHTHE PAINTER MOVED TO BATH IN  HE FOUND THAT THE PICKFORD OF THEDAY WHO HAD THE CARRYING TRADE OF THE BATH ROAD WAS NO ORDINARYCARRIER BUT A MAN OF TASTE AND CULTURE AND READY TO DO ANYTHING HECOULD TO HELP ART AND ARTISTS. HE WAS A CERTAIN JOHN WILTSHIRE ANDBEFORE GAINSBOROUGH HAD BEEN LONG A RESIDENT AT BATH HE WAS WILTSHIRESFAST FRIEND AND IN THE ENJOYMENT OF A VERY TANGIBLE PROOF OFFRIENDSHIP FOR WILTSHIRE CARRIED TO LONDON GRATIS EVERY PICTURETHAT GAINSBOROUGH NEEDED TO SEND THITHER. NOT A PENNY WOULD HE TAKE FORCARRIAGE. NO NO HE WOULD SAY WHEN THE PAINTERS MODESTY LED HIM TOPROTEST AGAINST SUCH GENEROSITY I ADMIRE PAINTING TOO MUCH FOR THAT.NO DOUBT HE DID AND IT MUST BE SAID THAT IN RETURN FOR HIS GOODNESSGAINSBOROUGH GAVE HIM MANY A CHARMING BIT OF WORK ON WHICH TO FEAST HISEYES. LET US HOPE WE HAVE BEFORE US THE BOOKPLATE OF THIS KIND OFWORTHY MAN AS ALLAN CUNNINGHAM CALLED HIM WHO LOVED GAINSBOROUGH ANDADMIRED HIS WORKS.ILLUSTRATIONOF COURSE THE PLATE IS TWENTY YEARS EARLIER THAN THE COMMENCEMENT OFGAINSBOROUGHS RESIDENCE AT BATH AND OF HIS FRIENDSHIP WITH WILTSHIREBUT WHAT OF THAT WILTSHIRE HAD BEEN LIKELY ENOUGH A LOVER OF THINGSBEAUTIFUL AND THE OWNER OF BOOKS LONG BEFORE THERE IS NO NECESSITY FORIMAGINING THAT HIS WAS A SUDDEN CONVERSION TO A SELFSACRIFICING LOVEFOR ART PRODUCED BY INTIMACY WITH GAINSBOROUGH.ANOTHER INTERESTING ENGLISH BOOKPLATE IN WHICH ALLEGORY PLAYS A PARTIS THAT ALSO BY J. SKINNER OF WILLIAM OLIVER DOCTOR OF MEDICINEPHILANTHROPIST AND INVENTOR OF BISCUITS. IT IS JUDGING FROM THE FORMOF THE ENGRAVERS SIGNATURE OF ABOUT THE SAME DATE AS THE WILTSHIREBOOKPLATE. THE SHIELD BEARING THE OLIVER COATOFARMS RESTS UPON APLATFORM ON WHICH STAND TWO FIGURES AS IN THE EXAMPLE LAST DESCRIBEDBUT INSTEAD OF THESE FIGURES BEING REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DRAMA AND OFLITERATURE THEY ARE AN ANCIENT AND A MODERN MEDICAL PRACTITIONER THEFORMER PERHAPS EVEN THE GOD OF MEDICINE HIMSELF. THIS WAS QUITEAPPROPRIATE FOR OLIVER THOUGH A MAN OF CULTURED TASTES IN VARIED WALKSOF LIFE AND ONE WHO MIGHT HAVE APPROPRIATELY COMMITTED THE CARE OF HISFAMILY ESCUTCHEON TO THE ALLEGORIC REPRESENTATIVES OF MANY ARTS WASFIRST AND FOREMOST A DOCTOR OF MEDICINE. THE MODERN DOCTOR IS ARRAYED INCAP AND GOWN AND STANDS ON THE LEFT OF THE SHIELD WITH HANDOUTSTRETCHED TOWARDS HIS FELLOW OF OLD TIME. BELOW THE PLATFORM ON ATRIANGLE IS A CLUB AROUND WHICH THE SERPENT OF SCULAPIUS ENTWINESITSELF.ILLUSTRATIONOLIVERS LIFE LASTED FOR HARD ON SEVENTY YEARS TO  AFTERSETTLING AT BATH AND COMMENCING PRACTICE HIS RISE TO FAME WASREMARKABLE FOR ITS RAPIDITY AND AS QUITE EARLY IN HIS CAREER HE BUSIEDHIMSELF WITH HOSPITAL BUILDING HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT AND OTHER GOODWORKS HE SOON MADE FOR HIMSELF A NUMBER OF ENEMIES AMONGST HISFELLOWPRACTITIONERS LESS CAPABLE AND LESS ENERGETIC THAN HIMSELF. AS APHYSICIAN AND PHILANTHROPIST HE IS NOW FORGOTTEN AS THE INVENTOR OF ABISCUIT HE IS REMEMBEREDFOR THE BATH OLIVER STILL HOLDS ITS OWNAGAINST THE MULTITUDE OF MODERN COMPETITORS AND IS STILLSO THE MAKERSSAYPREPARED FROM DR. OLIVERS ORIGINAL RECEIPT. THAT RECEIPT HECONFIDED WHEN ON HIS DEATHBED TO HIS COACHMAN GIVING HIM  INMONEY AND TEN SACKS OF THE FINEST FLOUR WHEREWITH TO CONTINUE THEPRODUCTION OF THE THEN ALREADY POPULAR BISCUITS. WITH THE MONEY THECOACHMAN OPENED A SHOP IN GREEN STREET BATH AND SO GOT TOGETHER ACOMFORTABLE FORTUNE. OF SKINNER TO WHOM WE OWE THESE TWO PLATES WESHALL HAVE MORE TO SAY PRESENTLY PP.  IN REFERRING TO THEENGRAVERS OF ENGLISH BOOKPLATES.TEN YEARS AFTER THE WILTSHIRE PLATE COMES OUR NEXT DISTINCTLY ALLEGORICBOOKPLATE ENGRAVED BY A SECONDRATE ENGRAVER FOR JOHN DUICK.

GASCOIGNENOR YET ANY OTHER EIGHTEENTH CENTURY YORKSHIRE GENTLEMAN IS TASTING THESWEETS OF HIS LITERARY COLLECTION THE LIBRARY IS TENANTED BY A COUPLEOF MYTHOLOGICAL FEMALES OF SUCH SUBSTANTIAL FORMS THAT LORD DE TABLEYTHINKS THEY MUST REPRESENT TWO YORKSHIRE DAMSELS MASQUERADING ONE AS AMUSE AND THE OTHER AS APOLLO.

CIPRIANI BARTOLOZZI AND HIS PUPIL SHERWIN WERESHOWING ENGLISHMEN HOW ALLEGORY COULD BE REPRESENTED ON BOOKPLATESWITHOUT BEING CLUMSY AND RIDICULOUS AND THE LESSER ARTISTS WEREIMITATING THEIR WORK WITH MORE OR LESS SUCCESS.ONE OF BARTOLOZZIS EARLIEST BOOKPLATES WAS EXECUTED FOR SIR FOSTERCUNLIFFE BART. THE DESCENDANT OF A VERY FAMOUS LIVERPOOL MERCHANT. THECUNLIFFE ARMS APPEAR IN MIDAIR RESTING UPON A BANK OF CLOUDS TWOEXQUISITELY DRAWN CHERUBS SUPPORT THE SHIELD OVER WHICH IS FOLDEDDRAPERY. THE CHERUB ON THE DEXTER SIDE IS SEATED AND HOLDS A CADUCEUSIN HIS RIGHT HAND. THE ONE ON THE SINISTER SIDE IS FURNISHED WITH TWOTRUMPETS AND IS BLOWING THAT IN HIS LEFT HAND. ON A MEDALLION ABOVE THESHIELD IS THE CUNLIFFE CREST WITH THE MOTTO FIDELITER. THE PLATEWHICH WAS AFTERWARDS ALTERED FOR SIR ROBERT H. CUNLIFFE BART. IS INALL PROBABILITY CIPRIANIS DESIGN FOR THAT ARTIST SIGNS HIS NAME ASDESIGNER OF AN ALMOST SIMILAR BOOKPLATE FOR JEAN TOMMINS WHICH WASENGRAVED BY FORD SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE. A VERY COARSE IMITATION OF THEDESIGN WAS ALSO USED BY THOMAS ANSON OF SHUGHBOROUGH WHO INTRUSTED THEIMITATION TO YATES.SIR FOSTER CUNLIFFE WAS A GRANDSON OF FOSTER CUNLIFFE KING CHARLES THESECONDS GODSON THE LIVERPOOL MERCHANT WHO ACCORDING TO FOSTERSLANCASHIRE FAMILIES BECAME NOT ONLY THE FIRST MAN IN LIVERPOOL BUTWAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A MORE EXTENDED COMMERCE THAN ANY MERCHANT IN THEKINGDOM AND DECLINED ALL SOLICITATIONS THAT HE SHOULD REPRESENTLIVERPOOL IN PARLIAMENT.THE REMARKABLY LARGE EXAMPLE OF BARTOLOZZIS WORK WHICH HAS OFTEN BEENDESCRIBED AS THE BOOKPLATE OF GEORGE III. DOES NOT APPEAR EVER TO HAVEBEEN USED AS SUCH. IN THE PREVIOUS EDITION OF THIS BOOK I ALLUDED TO ITAT P.  AS POSSIBLY A GIFT TO THE KING IN WHICH AT THE EXPENSE OFUTILITY BARTOLOZZI SOUGHT TO DISPLAY HIS GRATITUDE TO AND ADMIRATIONFOR THE SOVEREIGN UNDER WHOM HE HAD COME TO RESIDE IT DOES NOTHOWEVER SEEM THAT BARTOLOZZI INTENDED THE ENGRAVING FOR A BOOKPLATE ATALL BUT DESIGNED IT FOR THE TITLEPAGE OF A FOLIO VOLUME ISSUED IN WHICH CONTAINED ENGRAVINGS OF THIRTYSIX STATESMEN OF THE REIGN OFHENRY VIII. FROM DRAWINGS BY HOLBEIN. I WILL GIVE A SHORT DESCRIPTIONOF THE ENGRAVING IN QUESTION SO THAT IT MAY BE MORE EASILY RECOGNISEDBY THE COLLECTOR IF OFFERED TO HIM AS A BOOKPLATE. IT SHOWS US THEARMS OF ENGLAND AS BORNE BY GEORGE III. PRIOR TO THE UNION WITHIRELAND UPHELD IN MIDAIR BY THREE INHABITANTS OF THE SKIES. ABOVE THESHIELD A FOURTH CELESTIAL BEING IS FLYING AND AT THE SAME TIME HOLDINGALOFT HIS MAJESTYS CROWN. ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE PLATE IS THE FIGUREOF FAME WHO ON A LONG TRUMPET PLACED TO HER LIPS IS EVIDENTLY GIVINGA SONOROUS BLAST. THIS IS PERHAPS THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE PART OF THEDESIGN FOR THE WHOLE WEIGHT OF THIS SOMEWHAT MASSIVE YOUNG LADY IS UPONTHE SHIELD WHICH WE HAVE SAID IS IN MIDAIR AND ONLY SUPPORTED BYTHREE CHERUBS WHOSE UNITED MUSCULAR POWERS STRIKE ONE AS TOTALLYINADEQUATE TO BEAR THE BURDEN IMPOSED UPON THEM.ILLUSTRATIONIN  BARTOLOZZI THEN A ROYAL ACADEMICIAN EXECUTED HIS MOSTBEAUTIFUL BOOKPLATE. IT IS INSCRIBED H. F. BESSBOROUGH AND WAS MADEFOR LADY HENRIETTA FRANCES SPENCER WHO IN  MARRIED FREDERICKTHIRD EARL OF BESSBOROUGH. THE DESIGN SHOWS US A ROMAN INTERIOR WITH ANEXQUISITELY DRAWN VENUS SEATED AND HOLDING IN HER LEFT HANDWHICH ISUPLIFTEDA BURNING HUMAN HEART AND IN HER RIGHT A DOVE. BEHIND HER ISA VASE OF FLOWERS. THE OTHER INMATES OF THE ROOM ARE TWO CUPIDS WHOHOLD ABOVE THE GODDESS A LONG SCARF BEARING LADY BESSBOROUGHS NAME. THEDESIGN IS CIPRIANIS. BESIDES HIS SIGNATURE AND THAT OF THE ENGRAVERTHERE IS ALSO ON THE BOOKPLATE PUBLISHED DEC.   BY F.BARTOLOZZI. IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT IN  HOGARTH BY HIS OWNEXERTIONS ON BEHALF OF HIS BROTHER ARTISTS MANAGED TO GET AN ACTTHROUGH PARLIAMENTA BODY THAT THEN PROBABLY CARED LITTLE FOR ART ORARTISTSBY WHICH DESIGNERS AND ENGRAVERS OBTAINED A COPYRIGHT IN THEIROWN WORKS AND IT IS A SINGULAR TESTIMONY TO THE POPULARITY OFBARTOLOZZIS WORK THAT ON SO TRIVIAL A WORK AS A BOOKPLATE IT WASFOUND NECESSARY TO ADOPT THIS FORMULA OF PUBLICATION. BY THE KINDNESS OFTHE HON. GERALD PONSONBY I AM ENABLED TO STATE THAT BARTOLOZZISRECEIPT FOR THIS TICKET PLATE AS HE CALLS IT BEARS AS ITS DATE THETH DECEMBER  THE DAY BEFORE THE DATE OF PUBLICATION. IT ISNOTEWORTHY THAT BARTOLOZZI RECEIVED  FOR HIS WORK. THE BOOKPLATE ISGIVEN ON THE PREVIOUS PAGE.QUITE DISTINCT FROM THIS JOYOUS BOOKPLATE IS ANOTHER EXECUTED BY THESAME ARTIST FOR A SPANISH LADY WHICH WE MAY CLASS AS ENGLISH SINCE ITWAS NO DOUBT ENGRAVED BY HIM IN ENGLAND. ISABEL DE MENEZES THE LADY FORWHOM THIS BOOKPLATE WAS DESIGNED WAS AS SHE TELLS US ON IT IN THESEVENTYFIRST YEAR OF HER AGE. ALLEGORIC FIGURES DISPORTING THEMSELVESIN YOUTHFUL FROLIC WOULD PERHAPS HAVE BEEN OUT OF KEEPING ON THEBOOKPLATE OF A LADY AT THAT SOMBRE TIME OF LIFE AND SO THE DESIGNERHAS RUN TO THE OTHER EXTREME. GLOOMINESS PREDOMINATES IN THISBOOKPLATE. A PARTLY RUINED SQUAREBUILT TOMB IS ERECTED ON A PROMONTORYABOVE THE SEA BRIARS AND OTHER CREEPERS HAVE GROWN ROUND IT AND HADCOVERED IT TILL THE KNEELING FEMALE FIGURE DREW THEM DOWN IN ORDER TOPLACE UPON THE TOMB A COMMEMORATIVE INSCRIPTION. BESIDE THE FIGURE IS ACUPID WHO POINTS TO THE NEWLYCUT WORDS. IT HAS BEEN THOUGHT THAT THISMAY HAVE BEEN DESIGNED FOR A VISITING CARD IT IS QUITE IN THE FASHIONOF SUCH THINGS AT THE DATE AND IT IS LIKELY ENOUGH THAT ISABEL DEMENEZES USED THE PLATE BOTH AS A CARD AND AS A MARK OF OWNERSHIP FORHER BOOKS.THERE ARE BESIDES THOSE DESCRIBED A NUMBER OF ENGLISH BOOKPLATESWHICH IN STYLE MUCH RESEMBLE BARTOLOZZIS WORK. IF THEY ARE HIS THEYPROBABLY DATE BEFORE  FOR THE ADOPTION OF THE PUBLICATION FORMULABEFORE NOTICED MAKES IT IMPROBABLE THAT HE EXECUTED ANY WORK WHILST INENGLAND THAT HE DID NOT THUS PROTECT. AFTER HIS DEPARTURE FROM THISCOUNTRY HE PRODUCED FROM A DRAWING BY SIGNEIRA A BOOKPLATE FOR SIRTHOMAS GAGE BART. OF HENGRAVE HALL SUFFOLK. IN THIS A FEMALE FIGURESITS UPON A STONE AGAINST WHICH IS A PLAIN SHIELD BEARING THE GAGEARMS. THE PLATE IS SIGNED BARTOLOZZI LISBON . THERE IS ADISTINCT RESEMBLANCE IN THIS BOOKPLATE TO THAT WHICH WAS ENGRAVEDEITHER IN  OR  FOR RICHARD HOARE ELDEST SON OF THE LORD MAYOROF LONDON. HE WAS CREATED A BARONET IN THE FORMER YEAR AND DIED IN THELATTER. IN THIS WE HAVE A SEATED FEMALE CLASSICALLY DRAPED WHO RESTSHER LEFT ELBOW ON A CIPPUS ON WHICH IS ENGRAVED A SHIELD BEARING THEARMS OF HOARE. RICHARD HOARE MARRIED THE HEIRESS OF STOURHEAD AND HISSON WAS SIR RICHARD COLT HOARE THE FAMOUS ANTIQUARY AND AUTHOR. THEDATE AT WHICH THIS PLATE MUST HAVE BEEN EXECUTED  OR  DOES NOTALLOW THE ABSENCE OF THE ENGRAVERS NAME AND FORMULA OF PUBLICATION TOTELL AGAINST THE WORK BEING BARTOLOZZIS HIS FAME WAS NOT THEN SOGREAT AND HE FOUND IT LESS NECESSARY TO PROTECT HIS ENGRAVINGS FROMPIRACY SEE P. .BEAUTIFUL AS ARE BARTOLOZZIS BOOKPLATES IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT HISCAPABILITIES AS A DESIGNER OR AN ENGRAVER ARE DEMONSTRATED IN THESEWORKS OF A LARGER KIND SHOWED FORTH HIS TALENTS FAR MORE.SO THEN ALLEGORY AT LENGTH CAME TO BE ALMOST POPULAR WITH ENGLISHBOOKPLATE OWNERS AND VARIOUS LESSER ARTISTSHENSHAW ROE POLLARDAND SOME OTHERSPRODUCED IT IN IMITATION OF BARTOLOZZI WITH ONLYINDIFFERENT SUCCESS. BUT BEFORE ENDING THIS CHAPTER WE MUST SAYSOMETHING ABOUT THE BOOKPLATE WORK OF BARTOLOZZIS CHIEF ENGLISH PUPILJOHN KEYS SHERWIN. IN  THE YEAR AFTER HE GAINED THE ROYAL ACADEMYSGOLD MEDAL FOR DRAWING HE EXECUTED AN EXTREMELY PRETTY ALLEGORICBOOKPLATE FOR JOHN MITFORD OF PITTS HILL. IT REPRESENTS AN INFANTNEPTUNE WITH HIS TRIDENT SEATED ON A LARGE SHELL WHICH IS UPON THEBACK OF A SEAHORSE. YOUNG NEPTUNES DRAPERY FORMS A GRACEFUL CANOPYAND HE SUPPORTS IN HIS RIGHT HAND A SMALL SHELL WHICH DISPLAYS THEMITFORD ARMS AND CREST. A DOLPHIN SPOUTING WATER IN FOUNTAINLIKESPRAYS SWIMS BY HIS SIDE. THERE ARE TWO STATES OF THIS PLATE ONEHAVING THE ARMS INCORRECTLY SHADED BOTH ARE SIGNED BY SHERWIN.IN CLOSING OUR REMARKS ON ENGLISH BOOKPLATES DESIGNED AFTER THISFASHION NOTICETHOUGH ONLY A PASSING ONE FOR IT IS SPOKEN OF FULLYLATER ONMUST BE TAKEN OF THE CHARMING BOOKPLATE WHICH AGNES BERRYDESIGNED IN  FOR HER FRIEND MRS. DAMER. I MENTION IT HERE ONLY TOASSOCIATE IT IN THE READERS MIND WITH ALLEGORIC BOOKPLATES.SO MUCH FOR ALLEGORY ON ENGLISH BOOKPLATES. IT IS TO THE CREDIT OFENGLISHMEN THAT ALLEGORIC WORK DID NOT BECOME POPULAR UNTIL SOMETHINGREALLY ARTISTIC IN THIS PARTICULAR STYLE WAS PRODUCED AND THAT EVENBEFORE THAT TIME ALLEGORY NEVER RAN QUITE SO WILD ON ENGLISHBOOKPLATES AS IT DID ON FOREIGN EXAMPLES. M. POULET MALASSIS ASSURES USTHAT INTO ONE FRENCH BOOKPLATE OF THE LAST CENTURY WERE CROWDED THEWHOLE PERSONNEL OF OLYMPUSFOOTNOTES THE DESIGN HAS BEEN MORE RECENTLY USED BY THOMAS GAINSFORD. WILLIAM OLIVERS PLATE FROM BIBLIOGRAPHICA VOL. II. P. .CHAPTER VENGLISH PICTURE BOOKPLATESIN TURNING NOW TO CONSIDER ENGLISH BOOKPLATES WHICH SHOW US APART FROMTHE HERALDRY UPON THEM THINGS WHOLLY REAL WE FIND MUCH THAT ISINTERESTING. FIRST WE HAVE PORTRAIT BOOKPLATES THOSE WHICH EITHERCOMBINED WITH HERALDRY OR ENTIRELY WITHOUT IT SHOW US THE FEATURES OFTHE OWNER OF THE VOLUME. THERE ARE BUT FEW OF SUCH BOOKPLATES BUT THEYARE SO INTERESTING THAT WE SHALL SPEAK OF THEM BY THEMSELVES LATER ONPP.  THEY ARE COMMON TO ALL PERIODS AND THE FASHION OF USINGTHEM HAS INCREASED LATELY.THEN WE HAVE BOOKPLATES IN WHICH BOOKS THEMSELVESBOOK PILES OR BOOKSHELVESARE THE PREDOMINATING FEATURE IN THE DESIGN WITH THESE SIRARTHUR VICARS IN THE PAGES OF THE EX LIBRIS JOURNAL HAS DEALTEXHAUSTIVELY. THOUGH THE BOOKPLATES WHICH SHOW US LIBRARY INTERIORSWOULD SEEM NATURALLY TO COME INTO THIS CLASS OF EXAMPLES I HAVE BEENFORCED TO EXCEPT THE MAJORITY OF THEM AND TO SPEAK OF THEM IN THEPREVIOUS CHAPTER AS BEING IN NEARLY EVERY CASE AT LEAST TINGED WITHALLEGORY. EVEN IN THE SANCTUM OF A DOCTOR OF DIVINITY CUPID FROLICSABOUT AS HAPPY AND AS BUSY AS IN A MAIDENS BOUDOIR. STILL THERE ARE AFEW LIBRARY INTERIORS ENTIRELY FREE FROM ALLEGORY. TAKE FOR INSTANCETHE BOOKPLATE OF SIR ROBERT CUNLIFFE. HERE WE HAVE THE INTERIOR OF ALIBRARY WITH A WINDOW TO THE RIGHT. EVERY ORNAMENT IS THOROUGHLYCHIPPENDALE IN CHARACTER THE LEGS OF THE TABLE THE CARTOUCHE WHICHCONTAINS THE NAME THE SHIELD AND THE WOODWORK SURROUNDING THE WINDOW.ON THE TABLE IS A GLOBE UPON A STAND THE SUPPORTS OF WHICH TERMINATEIN CHIPPENDALE SCROLLS AN INKSTAND WITH A PEN ON IT AND TWO BOOKS ONECLOSED AND THE OTHER OPEN. THERE ARE NUMBERS OF BOOKS CONFUSEDLYDISPOSED ON THE SHELVES THE CEILING OF THE ROOM IS PLAIN AND THERE ISONLY A PLAIN LINE FOR A CORNICE. THE ARMS OCCUPY THE CENTRE OF THEPLATE AND APPEAR TO BE SUSPENDED IN MIDAIR THE FOOT OF ONE OF THESCROLLS ONLY RESTING ON THE TABLE.AGAIN THE BOOKPLATES OF THE MANCHESTER SUBSCRIPTION LIBRARY THEMANCHESTER CIRCULATING LIBRARY AND THE ROCHDALE CIRCULATING LIBRARYALL SHOW INTERIORS OF LIBRARIES BUT FREE FROM ALLEGORIC INMATES. THESETHREE BOOKPLATES ARE NEARLY IDENTICAL. THERE ARE SHELVES OF BOOKS ATTHE SIDES A TILED FLOOR A TABLE IN THE FOREGROUND A PANELLED CEILINGWITH A CORNICE AND AT THE END OF THE ROOM PERHAPS A PASSAGE. THERE ISA ROUND ARCH CONTAINING A WINDOW OF THREE LIGHTS THE CENTRE ONE HAVINGA ROUND TOP. THE GENERAL APPEARANCE OF THE ROOM IS CLASSICAL VERYSIMILAR IS THE BOOKPLATE OF THE LIVERPOOL LIBRARY. HERE WE HAVE ACOMPLICATED CHIPPENDALE BOOKCASE WITH TEN COLUMNS UPON SQUARE BASESAND ORNAMENTAL CAPITALS OF NO PARTICULAR STYLE. THE SHELVES ARE FILLEDWITH BOOKS AND THE TWO CENTRAL DIVISIONS OF THE BOOKCASE ARE ALLCUPBOARDS. IN THE CENTRE OF THE CASE AMONG CHIPPENDALE SCROLLS IS THECREST OF THE TOWN AND BELOW THE CENTRAL DIVISION OF THE BOOKCASE ARETHE WORDS LIVERPOOL LIBRARY IN TWO LINES. BELOW THE WHOLE IS A LARGECARTOUCHE IN THE SAME STYLE AS THE REST OF THE PLATE INSCRIBEDALLOWED FOR READING . . . . DAYS. FORFEITURE . . . D. PER DAY. MR.J. PAUL RYLANDS IN HIS INTERESTING NOTES ON BOOKPLATES TELLS USTHAT THIS LIBRARY NOW THE LYCEUM WAS FOUNDED ON THE ST OF MAY THE BOOKPLATE WAS NO DOUBT ENGRAVED SOON AFTERWARDS AS ALL THEORNAMENTATION INTRODUCED IS CERTAINLY CHIPPENDALE. SO TOO IS THAT ONTHE BOOKPLATE ENGRAVED BY JOHN PINE IN  WHICH THE BENCHERS OFGRAYS INN USED FOR THEIR VOLUMES. HERE A SHELLSHAPED SHIELD BEARINGTHE ARMS OF THE LEARNED AND HONOURABLE SOCIETY IS APPARENTLY FASTENEDON TO A BACKGROUND OF BOOKSHELVES FILLED WITH BOOKS. SO MUCH FOR THELIBRARY INTERIORS. THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE VOLUMES IN THE OTHERBOOKPLATES IN WHICH BOOKS FORM THE CHIEF FEATURE OF DECORATION ISGENERALLY LIKE THAT SHOWN OPPOSITE IN THE BOOKPLATE OF WILLIAM HEWER ACOMMISSIONER OF THE NAVY AND THE FRIEND AND SECRETARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS.HOW THE SCROLL ON WHICH ARE EITHER THE OWNERS ARMS OR HIS NAME ISSUPPORTED IS NOT CLEAR.ILLUSTRATIONTHE BOOKPLATE OF SIR PHILIP SYDENHAM DATED  WHEN HE WAS AS HETELLS US TWENTYTHREE YEARS OF AGE OFFERS ANOTHER INTERESTING EXAMPLEOF THE BOOKPILE DESIGN SIR PHILIP SHOWS US HIS COAT OF ARMS ON THEFACE OF THE SCROLL ON THE LOWER ROLL OF WHICH IN VERY SMALL LETTERSIS WRITTEN THE INSCRIPTION. APPARENTLY NEITHER THIS NOR ANY OF HIS OTHERBOOKPLATES COMPLETELY SATISFIED HIM FOR DURING THE REMAINING FORTYYEARS OF HIS LIFE HE HAD MORE THAN HALFADOZEN DIFFERENT PLATESDESIGNED AND NEARLY ALL OF THESE ARE FOUND IN VARIOUS STATES. THEREARE MR. FINCHAM TELLS ME SOME SIXTEEN VARIETIES OF SIR PHILIPSBOOKPLATE MANY OF HIS BOOKS ARE NOW IN SION COLLEGE LIBRARY. IN THEBOOKPLATE OF WHITE KENNETT WHO FILLED THE SEE OF PETERBOROUGH FROM TO  WE SEE HOW THE EMBLEMS OF EPISCOPACY ARE TREATED WHENINTRODUCED INTO BOOKPLATES OF THIS TYPE. WHITE KENNETT HAD OTHERBOOKPLATES THE RAREST AND EARLIEST ENGRAVED WHEN HE WAS AT COLLEGEIS IN THE SIMPLE ARMORIAL STYLE. THESE BOOKPILE PLATES APPEAR ATINTERVALS DOWN TO THE CLOSE OF THE CENTURY AND THE STYLE HAS BEENRECENTLY REVIVED BY BOOKPLATE DESIGNERS IT IS SIMPLE AND CERTAINLYAPPROPRIATE. THE APPROXIMATE DATE OF EACH EXAMPLE MAY BE GENERALLYGATHERED FROM THE SHAPE OF THE SHIELD CONTAINING THE ARMS OR THE STYLEOF DECORATION AROUND IT.WE HAVE YET TO SPEAK OF BY FAR THE MOST NUMEROUS CLASS OF THOSE ENGLISHBOOKPLATES WHICH MAY BE PROPERLY BROUGHT INTO OUR SECOND DIVISION OFPICTURE BOOKPLATESI MEAN THE EXAMPLES WHICH REPRESENT UPON THEM ALANDSCAPE EITHER REAL OR IMAGINARY. THE REAL LANDSCAPES REPRESENTEDHAVE OF COURSE SOME DIRECT REFERENCE TO THE PLATE BEING A VIEWEITHER OF THE OWNERS HOUSE HIS PARK HIS PARISH CHURCH HIS TOWN ORVILLAGE OF SOME PARTICULAR SPOT IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF HISRESIDENCE OR OF SOME INCIDENT CONNECTED WITH HIS CAREER OROCCUPATIONBE IT BUSINESS PROFESSION OR PLEASURE.

PROBABLY THE EARLIEST OF THESE ISTHE VERY INTERESTING ONE SEE P.  WHICH WAS ENGRAVED BY MYNDE ABOUT FOR THE LIBRARY OF THE PUBLIC RECORD OFFICE THEN IN THE TOWER OFLONDON HERE WE HAVE A REMARKABLY FAITHFUL REPRESENTATION OF THEHISTORIC BUILDING. THE DATE AT WHICH THE TOWER BOOKPLATE WAS PROBABLYENGRAVED ADDS TO ITS INTEREST. PLATES IN THIS STYLE HARDLY APPEAR AT ALLBEFORE  OR  AND DO NOT BECOME COMMON TILL FIVE OR SIX YEARSLATER.THE BOOKPLATE OF PETER MUILMAN OF KING ST. LONDON AND KIRBY HALLCASTLE HEDINGHAM ESSEX IS ONE WHICH I THINK MAY BE CLASSED AMONGVIEW PLATES SINCE THE RUINS DEPICTED ON IT HAVE CERTAINLY THEAPPEARANCE OF HAVING BEEN SKETCHED FROM THE REMAINS OF SOME FEUDALSTRONGHOLD PERHAPS FROM CASTLE HEDINGHAM ITSELF. IN FRONT OF THE RUINSIS A WOODED LAWN ON WHICH TWO ROBUST CUPIDS ARE WRESTLING FOR THEMUILMAN ESCUTCHEON. KIRBY HALL IS NOT SHOWN NO DOUBT THIS WAS ACOMFORTABLE GEORGIAN HOUSE ROUND THE CORNER WHERE PETER AND HIS FAMILYSPENT THEIR SUMMER HOLIDAYS AWAY FROM THE BUSTLE AND SMOKE OF KINGSTREET. PRESUMABLY THE RUINS OF THE CASTLE WERE LEFT STANDING IN THEPARK FOR ORNAMENTS SAKE TO GIVE A TONE OF FEUDALISM TO THE MUILMANDOMAIN WHOSE OWNER SAVE BY HIS BOOKPLATE IS NOT KNOWN TO FAME. THEPLATE WAS ENGRAVED BY TERRY OF PATERNOSTER ROW PROBABLY ABOUT  SOTHAT THIS AGAIN IS AN EARLY EXAMPLE OF ITS KIND.ILLUSTRATIONAMONG OTHER NOTABLE SPECIMENS OF THESE VIEW BOOKPLATES MAY BEMENTIONED THAT WHICH PYE A BIRMINGHAM ENGRAVER EXECUTED FOR T. W.GREENE OF LICHFIELD. HERE WE HAVE AN OVALSHAPED SHIELD BEARING THEARMS OF GREENE RESTING AGAINST A TREESTUMP. IN THE DISTANCE IS ARIVER AND LICHFIELD CATHEDRAL. LATER ON PYE ENGRAVED A VERY SIMILARBOOKPLATE FOR ANOTHER LICHFIELD MANAN ATTORNEY NAMED NICHOLSON WHOWENT TO LIVE AT STOCKPORT. THIS SHOWS NICHOLSONS RESIDENCE ON THEMARGIN OF A SHEET OF WATER. THE ARMS REST AGAINST A SHATTERED OAKTREE.A LOCAL VIEWONE OF DARLINGTONALSO APPEARS ON THE BOOKPLATE OFGEORGE ALLEN WHO DESCRIBES HIMSELF AS OF THAT TOWN.COLLECTORS ARE WONT TO RECKON AS THE MOST INTERESTING EXAMPLE OF A VIEWBOOKPLATE THE VIGNETTE OF HORACE WALPOLES HOUSE AT STRAWBERRY HILLWITH HIS ARMS HANGING ON A SHIELD FROM A WITHERED TREE. MR. WHEATLEYHOWEVER WHO IS INCLINED TO ATTRIBUTE THE DESIGN TO WALPOLES FRIENDBENTLEY HAS SUGGESTED BIBLIOGRAPHICA VOL. III. P.  THAT THEVIGNETTE WAS NEVER USED AS A BOOKPLATE BUT WAS EXCLUSIVELY RESERVED ASA KIND OF PRINTERS DEVICE FOR THE ADORNMENT OF THE BOOKS PRINTED AT THESTRAWBERRY HILL PRESS. SIR WOLLASTON FRANKS HAS FOUR VARIETIES OF THEVIGNETTE ONE ENGRAVED ON WOOD AND THREE ON COPPER AND I HAVE CERTAINLYSEEN AT LEAST ONE OF THEM DOING DUTY AS A BOOKPLATE BUT WHETHERRIGHTFULLY OR NOT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY.MODERN EXAMPLES OF VIEW BOOKPLATES WERE TILL QUITE RECENTLY RARE. ONEOF THE QUAINTEST IS FURNISHED BY THAT USED BY THE LATE DR. KENDRICK OFWARRINGTON AND ENGRAVED FOR HIM IN  HERE WE HAVE A VIEW OF THEDOCTORS TOWN AS IT WAS IN  AND A PICTURE OF A LOYAL WARRINGTONVOLUNTEER OF . QUITE A USEFUL HISTORICAL PRINTNOW LET ME SAY A WORD ABOUT THE PICTURE BOOKPLATES ON WHICH THELANDSCAPE IS A FANCY ONE. PROMINENT AMONGST THESE IS THAT OF GILBERTWAKEFIELD WHICH SHOWS US A PRETTY SCENE A STAG STOOPS TO DRINK FROM ARIVULET THAT TRICKLES THROUGH A WOOD. VERY MUCH LATER IN DATE IS ACHARMING VIGNETTE REPRESENTING A ROCK OVER WHICH A STREAM OF WATERTRICKLES AND SPARKLES AS IT FALLS INTO A POOL BELOW. FERNS AND FLAGSGROW IN THE POOL. THE BOOKPLATE BELONGED TO JOSEPH PRIESTLEY AND ONTHAT ACCOUNT WE MENTION IT AFTER WAKEFIELDS. PRIESTLEY WAS QUITE ASBITTER A DISSENTER AND AS ARDENT A CONTROVERSIALIST AS GILBERTWAKEFIELD THOUGH IT IS MORE AS A MAN OF SCIENCE THAT MOST PEOPLEREMEMBER HIM. HIS NAME IS SO INTIMATELY ASSOCIATED WITH BIRMINGHAMPOLITICS AT THE TIME OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION THAT THE FACT OF HISBOOKPLATE BEING ENGRAVED BY A BIRMINGHAM MANIT IS SIGNED ALLEN SCT.BIRMINGMBECOMES THE MORE INTERESTING AND ENABLES US TO ASSIGN THEENGRAVING TO A MARKED PERIOD IN THE OWNERS LIFETHE TIME WHEN HISFRIENDSHIP WITH LORD SHELBURNE BEGAN TO COOL AND WHEN SETTLING DOWN ATBIRMINGHAM HE BEGAN WORK ON HIS HISTORY OF THE CORRUPTIONS OFCHRISTIANITY. JAMES YATES WHO EDITED PRIESTLEYS COLLECTED WORKS USEDTHE SAME BOOKPLATE AFTER ALTERING THE NAME UPON IT.ANOTHER DELIGHTFULLY RURAL SCENE IS DEPICTED ON THE BOOKPLATE OF JOHNHEWS BRANSBY. HIS MOTTO READS BREVE ET IRREPARABILE TEMPUS AND HESHOWS A RUSTIC LANDSCAPE IN WHICH THE FIGURES REPRESENTED HAVEEVIDENTLY LEARNT THE TRUTH OF THE ASSERTION. THE SOWER SCATTERS SEEDTHE PLOUGHBOY IS ENGAGED WITH HIS TEAMALL ARE MAKING THE MOST OFTHEIR TIME YET THERE IS NO SIGN OF HURRY OR BUSTLE. THE DAY IS FINEBUT CLOUDS HOVER IN THE SKY. ON THE LEFT A COTTAGE NESTLES IN THETREES AND THE SMOKE FROM ITS CHIMNEY TELLS OF THE HOUSEWIFE WITHINPREPARING A MEAL FOR THOSE WHO ARE EARNING IT BY THEIR LABOUR WITHOUT.SO MUCH FOR LANDSCAPES HAVING DIRECT REFERENCE TO THE BOOKPLATES ONWHICH THEY APPEAR. OFTEN HOWEVER THE LANDSCAPE IS PURELY A FANCY ONEAS THAT ON THE BOOKPLATE OF GREGORY LOUIS WAY. A RIVER FLOWS THROUGHFIELDS AND BESIDE IT SITS AN ARMOURCOATED KNIGHT WHO IS EITHERWEARIED WITH THE FIGHT OR BOWED DOWN BY THE FICKLENESS OF HIS LADY. HISSHIELD RESTS BESIDE HIM AND ON IT ARE DEPICTED THE ARMS OF WAY. THEMOON SHEDS UPON THE SCENE WHAT LIGHT SHE IS ABLE BUT THE SKY ISOVERCAST AND STORMY.I MUST NOT CLOSE THIS CHAPTER WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE BOOKPLATESPRODUCED BY THOMAS BEWICK MANY OF WHICH ARE FAMILIAR ENOUGHASEXAMPLES OF BEWICKS ARTTO THOSE WHO KNOW LITTLE ABOUT BOOKPLATESAND DO NOT COLLECT THEM. HIS ARE CERTAINLY FOR THE MOST PART LANDSCAPEPLATES BUT I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER TO CLASS THEM WITH THESE EXAMPLES OFVIEW BOOKPLATES OR WITH THOSE WHICH I HAVE CHRISTENED FANCYLANDSCAPES. THEY WERE CHIEFLY ENGRAVED FOR NORTHERN BOOKOWNERS BUTONE CAN HARDLY SAY THAT THE PARTICULAR BIT OF SCENERY ON EACHTHOUGHDOUBTLESS IN MOST CASES DRAWN FROM NATUREHAS ANY SPECIALAPPLICABILITY TO THE OWNER. I WILL THEREFORE SPEAK HERE OF BEWICKSBOOKPLATES AS FORMING A CLASS BY THEMSELVES. HIS FIRST WAS PREPARED FORTHOMAS BELL AND IS DATED  SO THAT IT IS INACCURATE TO SPEAK OFBEWICK AS THE ORIGINATOR OF THE LANDSCAPE STYLE IN BOOKPLATES HE FOUNDTHE STYLE ALREADY FOLLOWED BY MANY ENGRAVERS AND HIS TASTE AND SKILLBROUGHT IT TO PERFECTION. THE BELL PLATE IS NOT UNCOMMON AS THE BOOKSFOR WHICH IT WAS ENGRAVED WERE SOLD IN . IT SHOWS IN THE FOREGROUNDOF A LANDSCAPE AN OVAL SHIELD INSCRIBED T. BELL  AND RESTINGAGAINST A DECAYED TREE. IN THE DISTANCE ARE TREES AND ABOVE THEM RISESTHE TOWER OF ST. NICHOLASS CHURCH IN NEWCASTLEA FAVOURITE OBJECTWITH BEWICK. IT IS ALSO INTRODUCED BY RALPH BEILBY INTO THE BOOKPLATEOF BRAND THE ANTIQUARY.OUT OF THE HUNDRED OR SO BOOKPLATES DESIGNED OR ENGRAVED BY BEWICK ITIS DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHICH TO SELECT FOR COMMENT BUT FROM THE INTERESTWHICH ATTACHES TO ITS OWNER THAT OF ROBERT SOUTHEY FIGURED ON P. SUGGESTS ITSELF. HERE WE HAVE A ROCK THICKLY CROWNED WITH SHRUBBERYFROM WHICH A STREAM OF WATER FALLS INTO A BROOK BELOW. AGAINST THE FACEOF THE ROCK LEANS AN ARMORIAL SHIELD BEARING THE SOUTHEY ARMSACHEVRON BETWEEN THREE CROSSES CROSSLET. ON THE GROUND TO THE RIGHT OFTHE SHIELD AND IN CONTACT WITH IT IS THE HELMET SUPPORTING ON AWREATH THE CRESTAN ARM VESTED AND COUPED AT THE ELBOW HOLDING IN THEHAND A CROSSED CROSSLET. ACROSS THE SINISTER CHIEF CORNER OF THE SHIELDAND TRAILING THENCE TO THE GROUND IS THROWN THE RIBAND BEARING THEMOTTO IN LABORE QUIES. THE DATE OF THE BOOKPLATE IS PROBABLY ABOUT.NOT ONLY NEWCASTLE ITSELF BUT THE WHOLE LINE OF COUNTRY ALONG THE RIVERTHENCE TO TYNEMOUTH SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN BEWICKS SKETCHING GROUND ANDMANY OF HIS SKETCHES HE USED FOR BOOKPLATES. JARROW AND TYNEMOUTHITSELF WERE PARTICULARLY FAVOURITE SPOTS. OF THE LATTER PLACE HIS VIEWSWERE MOSTLY TAKEN FROM THE SEA AND AFFORD US DELIGHTFUL PICTURES OFWATER SHIPPING AND THE RUINS OF TYNEMOUTH PRIORY. THE BOOKPLATE OFCHARLES CHARLTON M.D. IS ONE OF THESE.ILLUSTRATION SOUTHEYS BOOKPLATE BY BEWICK.A GREAT MANY OF THE ORDINARY BITS OF LANDSCAPE WHICH BEWICK USED FORBOOKPLATES HE AFTERWARDS UTILISED AS TAILPIECES FOR VARIOUS BOOKSILLUSTRATED BY HIM. THE BOOKPLATE OF THE REV. H. COTES VICAR OFBEDLINGTON  WHICH SHOWS US THE REVEREND GENTLEMAN BUSILY ENGAGEDIN FISHING DOUBTLESS A FAVOURITE SPORT WITH HIM IS AN INSTANCE OF THISDIVERTED USE BUT IN THIS CASE WE KNOW THE HISTORY OF THE PLATE. MR.COTES HAD PRACTICALLY EDITED THE ARTISTS SECOND VOLUME OF BRITISHBIRDS AND AS A SLIGHT RETURN BEWICK PREPARED FOR HIM THE BOOKPLATEIN QUESTION BUT OWING TO A SUBSEQUENT QUARREL THE ARTIST NEVER GAVETHE PARSON THE BLOCK TURNING IT INSTEAD TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT.THERE ARE A GREAT MANY MORE COPPERPLATE BOOKPLATES BY BEWICK THAN ISGENERALLY SUPPOSED. ONE OF THE MOST ELABORATE IS THAT OF BUDDLEATKINSON WHICH REPRESENTS A BUBBLING TROUTSTREAM INTO WHICH ANANGLER CASTS HIS LINE IN THE FOREGROUND IS A CREST ENCLOSED IN ASHIELD.

BIGGESAFIGURE OF LIBERTY ALEXR DOEG SHIPBUILDERA JUSTCOMPLETED SHIPSTILL STANDING ON THE STOCKS AND SEVERAL OTHERS WHICH SIMPLY SHOW THESHIELD OF ARMS AND OWNERS NAME.ONE REASON WHY BEWICK WAS SO SUCCESSFUL AS AN ENGRAVER OF BOOKPLATESLAY IN THE FACT THAT HIS ABILITY WAS MOST CONSPICUOUS IN A SMALL DESIGN.THE WORK OF SUCH MEN AS HOGARTH OR BARTOLOZZI SEEMS CRAMPED WHEN ITAPPEARS ON THE SMALL SCALE WHICH ALONE A BOOKPLATE CAN ADMIT BUT WITHBEWICK THE SMALLER THE SIZE OF THE SCENE HE DESIRED TO REPRESENT THEGREATER WAS HIS SKILL IN INTRODUCING INTO IT BOTH ORIGINALITY ANDBEAUTY.CHAPTER VIGERMAN BOOKPLATESI HAVE SAID THAT THE USE OF BOOKPLATES WHETHER AS COMMEMORATIVE OFGIFTS OR AS MARKS OF OWNERSHIP ORIGINATED IN GERMANY. HERE WELL BEFORETHE CLOSE OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY WE FIND AT LEAST THREE UNDOUBTEDBOOKPLATES EXAMPLES OF WHICH HAVE SURVIVED UNTIL THE PRESENT DAY ANDHAVE RECENTLY BEEN DISCOVERED FULFILLING THE FUNCTION FOR WHICH THEYWERE ORIGINALLY INTENDED.FASTENED TO THE COVER OF AN OLD LATIN VOCABULARY WAS DISCOVERED THE MOSTANCIENT OF THESE BOOKPLATES.

A WRITTEN INSCRIPTION BENEATH IT STATESTHAT THE BOOK FOR WHICH IT WAS INTENDED AND IN WHICH IT WAS FOUNDBELONGED TO HILDEBRANDE BRANDENBURG OF BIBERACH WHO PRESENTED IT TOTHE CARTHUSIAN MONASTERY OF BUXHEIM OF WHICH HE WAS A MONK. THISBOOKPLATE WHICH IS RUDELY COLOURED IS STRUCK OFF ON SCRAPS OF PAPERPRINTED ON ONE SIDE A CURIOUS ILLUSTRATION OF THE THEN SCARCITY OF THATMATERIAL. ODDLY ENOUGH ANOTHER VERY EARLY BOOKPLATEPROBABLY OFALMOST THE SAME DATE AS THE LASTWAS ALSO FOUND IN A BOOK WHICHBELONGED TO THE SAME MONASTERY AND WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN TO IT BYWILHELM VON ZELL. THIS BOOKPLATE ALSO IS ANONYMOUS BUT THE VOLUMESTHAT CONTAINED IT AS IN THE LAST CASE BEAR A WRITTEN INSCRIPTIONRECORDING THE FACT THAT THEY BELONGED TO THE MONASTERY IN QUESTION ANDWERE THE GIFT OF THE PERSON WHOSE ARMS ARE FIGURED IN THE BOOKPLATEINSERTED.FROM THE FACT THAT TWO OF THE THREE KNOWN FIFTEENTH CENTURY BOOKPLATESARE CONNECTED WITH THE MONASTERY AT BUXHEIM IT WOULD SEEM AS IF THE USEOF A BOOKPLATE COMMENDED ITSELF TO THE LIBRARIAN OF THAT MONASTERY WHOCOMMEMORATED THE GIFTS OF VOLUMES BY A BOOKPLATE BEARING THE DONORSARMS.IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY GERMAN BOOKPLATES BECAME NUMEROUS AND OFTHEIR BEAUTY THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT. THERE IS A DIFFICULTY HOWEVER INACCEPTING MANY OF THE EARLY ARMORIAL WOODCUTS WHICH ONE FINDS AND IT ISTHIS SUPPOSE THE EXAMPLE IS NO LONGER DOING DUTY IN A VOLUME AS ABOOKPLATE THERE IS REALLY NO MEANS OF BEING ASSURED THAT THE CUT OFARMS IS A BOOKPLATE AT ALL FOR VERY MANY OF THESE PLATES ARE VOID OFANY INSCRIPTION SAVE PERHAPS A TEXT OR MOTTO. SOME OF THESEBOOKPLATES ARE PROBABLY THE WORK OR FROM THE DESIGN OF ALBERT DRER.HE CERTAINLY PRODUCED SOME UNDOUBTED EXAMPLES THE EARLIEST ACTUALLYDATED IN . THIS IS THE EBNER BOOKPLATE SEE P. .

AND WAS THE OWNER OF A LIBRARYWHOSE SUBSEQUENT HISTORY HAS BEEN TOLD IN BOOKS ABOUT BOOKS BY MR.ELTON IN HIS GREAT BOOK COLLECTORS. NOW THIS PORTRAIT PLATE WHICH ISDATED  WAS UNDOUBTEDLY USED BY PIRCKHEIMER AS HIS BOOKPLATE. THEREARE PLENTY OF KNOWN INSTANCES IN WHICH IT MAY BE STILL FOUND FASTENED INAT THE END OF A VOLUME. WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS INTENDED FOR ANY OTHERPURPOSE THAN THAT WHICH I HAVE HERE MENTIONED WE CANNOT SAY FOR ITBEARS NO INSCRIPTION EXPRESSING ITS USE. HOWEVERVERY POSSIBLY AT THESAME DATEDRER DESIGNED FOR PIRCKHEIMER WHAT WAS WITHOUT DOUBTINTENDED FOR A BOOKPLATE SINCE IT BEARS THE INSCRIPTION LIBERBILIBALDI PIRCKHEIMER. THIS IS IN MANY INSTANCES FOUND ON THE FRONTCOVER OF VOLUMES WHICH ALSO CONTAIN THE BOOKPLATE LAST DESCRIBEDFASTENED ON THE BACK COVER.IT IS A VERY STRIKING BOOKPLATE. A STRANGELY LARGE HELMET ON WHICH ISPLACED AN EQUALLY LARGE CREST SURMOUNTS A PAIR OF SHIELDS.

ANGELSAPPARENTLY AT PLAY ARE ALSO REPRESENTED BELOW THE SHIELD. EXAMPLES OFTHIS PLATE ARE NOT UNCOMMON IN ENGLISH COLLECTIONS MANY OFPIRCKHEIMERS BOOKS HAVING PASSED INTO THE LIBRARY OF THE ROYAL SOCIETYAND SOME OF THESE HAVING BEEN SOLD AS DUPLICATES WHEN THEY WERE BOUGHTUP BY COLLECTORS FOR THE SAKE OF THE BOOKPLATE. SIR WOLLASTON FRANKSPOINTS OUT TO ME THAT THERE IS YET A THIRD VARIETY OF PIRCKHEIMERSBOOKPLATE WHICH IS SIGNED J. B.  AND IS NOT THE WORK OF DRER.ILLUSTRATIONTHE BOOKPLATE OF HECTOR PMER PROVOST OF THE CHURCH OF ST. LAURENCE ATNUREMBERG DATED IN  IS ALSO ASCRIBED TO DRER THOUGH IT IS SIGNEDWITH THE INITIALS R. A. THIS SIGNATURE IS PROBABLY THAT OF THE ARTISTWHO CUT THE DESIGN UPON WOOD FOR IT IS NOW MAINTAINED THAT DRERHIMSELF ONLY MADE THE DRAWINGS FOR THE WOODCUTS KNOWN AS HIS THEMECHANICAL OPERATION OF CUTTING BEING HANDED OVER TO ASSISTANTS. THEPMER PLATE IS THE EARLIEST DATED BOOKPLATE WHICH BEARS A SIGNATUREEITHER OF THE DESIGNER OR THE ENGRAVER.THE SIZE OF THIS REALLY FINE EXAMPLE OF EARLY WOODENGRAVING IS INCHES BY . ON THE PRINCIPAL SHIELD IN THE DESIGN WE HAVE WHAT ARE NODOUBT THE ARMS OF THE MONASTERY THE GRIDIRON OF ST. LAURENCEQUARTERING THOSE OF PMER. THE GRIDIRON IS ON THE FIRST AND FOURTHQUARTERS WHILST THE SECOND AND THIRD CONTAIN WHAT IS HERALDICALLYDESCRIBED AS PER BEND SABLE  AND ARGENT THREE BENDLETS OF THEFIRST. WE SAY SABLE BECAUSE THE DARK MASS WHICH THE ARTIST HAS HERESHOWN IS PROBABLY MEANT TO REPRESENT THIS BUT ANY DARK COLOUR MAY HAVEBEEN INTENDED AS I HAVE ALREADY ENDEAVOURED TO SHOW SEE P. . THESELAST ARMS ARE VERY PROBABLY PMERS FOR IN ONE OF THE SMALL SHIELDSWHICH APPEAR IN EACH OF THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE DESIGN THEY OCCURAGAINTHE OTHER THREE SHIELDS BEING MOST LIKELY FILLED WITH ARMSQUARTERED BY THE PMER FAMILY. THE HELMET SURMOUNTING THE PRINCIPALSHIELD IS WITHOUT WREATH AND THE CREST IS A DEMINUN. THE MOTTO TOTHE PURE ALL THINGS ARE PURE IS GIVEN AS IN OTHER OF DRERSBOOKPLATES IN HEBREW GREEK AND LATIN. IN CHARGE OF THE SHIELD STANDSST. LAURENCE HIMSELF DRESSED IN A MONKS GARB AND HOLDING IN HIS RIGHTHAND THE INSTRUMENT OF HIS MARTYRDOM AND IN HIS LEFT THE PALM OFMARTYRDOM. THE NIMBUS APPEARS AROUND HIS HEAD. THE BEAUTY OF THE DESIGNIS APPARENT AT THE FIRST GLANCE AND IT BECOMES MORE APPARENT AS WELOOK INTO IT.DR. HECTOR PMER WAS THE LAST PRIOR OF THE ABBEY OF ST. LAURENCE INNUREMBERG. TO HIM ERASMUS GAVE A COPY OF HIS EDITION OF THE WORKS OF ST.AMBROSE ISSUED FROM FROBENS PRESS. THAT VERY COPY IS IN THE POSSESSIONOF THE REV. H. W. PEREIRA AND IN EACH OF THE TWO THICK VOLUMES IN WHICHTHE WORK IS CONTAINED IS PMERS BOOKPLATE. ONE IS STRUCK WITH THEEXQUISITE DETAIL AND TREATMENT AS MR. PEREIRA SAYS IN DESCRIBING THEPLATE THE EXPRESSION AND FIGURE OF ST. LAURENCE IS FULL OF SWEETNESSAND TENDER PATHOS.THE LIST OF ARMORIES BY DRER AS PRINTED BY BARTSCH IN VOL. VII. OFTHE PEINTREGRAVEUR GIVES US SOME TWENTY EXAMPLES ANY OF WHICH MAYHAVE BEEN USED AS BOOKPLATES. SOME IDEA AS TO WHETHER OR NOT AN EARLYARMORIAL PLATE IS REALLY A BOOKPLATE MAY HOWEVER BE GAINED BY TAKINGITS MEASUREMENT. A VERY LARGE ENGRAVING SHOULD BE REGARDED WITHSUSPICION THOUGH NOT NECESSARILY REJECTED AS A BOOKPLATE ON ACCOUNT OFITS SIZE. SIR WOLLASTON FRANKS POSSESSES A MAGNIFICENT BOOKPLATEMEASURING NO LESS THAN    INCHES WHICH IS AT THIS MOMENT STILLFULFILLING ITS ORIGINAL FUNCTIONS. THIS IS CERTAINLY THE LARGEST EXAMPLEYET DISCOVERED. IT HAS BEEN KNOWN TO COLLECTORS FOR SOME TIME IN WHATWAS BELIEVED TO BE A PERFECT STATE BUT THE COPY JUST MENTIONED SHOWSTHAT WHAT WAS THOUGHT TO BE THE WHOLE WAS IN REALITY ONLY A PORTION OFTHE DESIGN SINCE IT LACKED THE ELABORATE FRAMEWORK WHICH IS RICHLYEMBELLISHED WITH WEAPONS AND ENSIGNS AS WELL AS WITH MUSICALINSTRUMENTS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION. THIS BOOKPLATE BELONGED TO COUNTMAXIMILIAN LOUIS BREINER A DISTINGUISHED OFFICIAL OF THE EMPEROR OFAUSTRIA IN LOMBARDY. A STRIKING FEATURE IN IT IS THE INTRODUCTION ABOVETHE ARMS OF THE OWNER OF THE PLATE OF THOSE OF AUSTRIA SURMOUNTED BYTHE IMPERIAL CROWN SUPPORTED BY A COUPLE OF CHERUBS. BOTH THE DESIGNAND ENGRAVING ARE THE WORK OF GIUSEPPE PETRARCA WHO PROBABLY PRODUCEDTHEM DURING THE CLOSING YEARS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.ILLUSTRATIONQUITE IN A DISTINCT STYLE FROM THE OTHER GERMAN BOOKPLATES MENTIONED ISTHAT FIGURED OPPOSITE WHICH MAY BE DATED ABOUT THE YEAR . IT ISINTERESTING FROM ITS OWNER ONE PAULUS SPERATUS AN ARDENT PREACHER OFTHE LUTHERAN DOCTRINE AT AUGSBURG WRTTEMBERG SALZBURG AND VIENNAAND AFTERWARDS BISHOP OF POMERANIA WHO PROVED HIMSELF READY TO UNDERGOSUFFERING IN THE CAUSE HE IMAGINED TO BE RIGHT. HE WAS BORN IN  ANDDIED IN . THE SHADING IN THE ARMS IS VERY PECULIAR EXPRESSING AS ITDOES ON THE FIRST AND FOURTH DIVISIONS OF THE SHIELD ARGENT ANDVERT AT A PERIOD AS WE HAVE SEEN LONG ANTERIOR TO THE USE OF LINESOR DOTS TO EXPRESS THE METALS OR TINCTURES IN HERALDRY. AN EXPLANATIONIS NO DOUBT TO BE FOUND IN THE FACT THAT THE ARTIST ONLY INTENDED TOREPRESENT SOME LIGHT COLOUR IN THE SHADED PARTS IN THE SAME WAY AS INTHE SECOND AND THIRD DIVISIONS OF THE SHIELD HE DESIRED IN THE THICKLYINKED PARTS TO REPRESENT SABLE. THE BOOKPLATE IS NOW PRESERVED IN ACOPY OF THE PSALMS TRANSLATED INTO RUSSIAN BY FRANCIS SKORINA ANDPRINTED AT WILNA ABOUT THE YEAR . THE PECULIAR INSCRIPTION ON THISBOOKPLATE IS REFERRED TO ON P. .WE HAVE SPOKEN SOMEWHAT FULLY ABOUT THESE EARLY EXAMPLES OF GERMANBOOKPLATES BECAUSE BOTH FROM THE FACT THAT THEY ARE THE EARLIESTKNOWN TO US AND THAT SEVERAL OF THEM ARE THE DESIGNS OF ALBERT DRERTHEY HAVE A VERY SPECIAL INTEREST. SPACE PRECLUDES THE POSSIBILITY OFALLUDING IN DETAIL TO LATER GERMAN EXAMPLES THOUGH THEY ARE MANY OFTHEM EXCEEDINGLY BEAUTIFUL SPECIMENS OF THE ENGRAVERS ART AS INDEEDTHEY MAY WELL BE CONSIDERING THE MEN WHO ENGRAVED THEMLUCAS CRANACHJOST AMMAN HANS TROSCHEL WOLFFGANG KILIAN OF AUGSBURG AND THE UNCLEAND NEPHEW GILES AND JOSEPH SADELER.LET ME HOWEVER SPEAK VERY TERSELY OF A FEW EXAMPLES OF THE PRODUCTIONSOF THESE ARTISTS IN ORDER THAT THE READERS ATTENTION MAY BE ATTRACTEDSHOULD HE COME ACROSS A SPECIMEN OF THEIR WORK.TWO WOODCUTS BY LUCAS CRANACH HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN USED AS BOOKPLATESTHOUGH NOT DESIGNED BY THE ARTIST AS SUCH FOR THEY BOTH APPEAR AMONGOTHER CUTS IN A WORK ILLUSTRATED BY HIM. SIR WOLLASTON FRANKS POSSESSESBOTH VARIETIES. IN ONE WE HAVE A HALFLENGTH FIGURE OF ST. PAUL. HE ISSEATED AND READING A BOOK THE LINES OF WHICH HE FOLLOWS WITH HISFINGER. HIS HEAD IS SURROUNDED WITH THE NIMBUS WHILST A SHAGGY BEARDNEARLY COVERS THE FACE. THE RIGHT HAND HOLDS A DOUBLE SWORD WITH THEPOINTS UPWARDS BENEATH THIS IS THE SHIELD OF THE ELECTOR OF SAXONY.ABOVE THE UPPER LINE OF THE PLATE IS AN INSCRIPTION SHOWING THAT IT WASINTENDED TO MARK THE VOLUMES BELONGING TO THE PREACHERSHIPPREDICATUR AT ORINGEN. THE OTHER WOODCUT BY CRANACH IS VERY SIMILARIN DESIGN BUT THE FIGURE REPRESENTED IS THAT OF ST. PETER AND IT BEARSTHE INSCRIPTION STADT ORNGAU.IT IS WORTH REMARKING THAT IN ONE INSTANCE AT LEAST ON REMOVING THEBOOKPLATE PORTRAYING ST. PAUL A SMALLER HANDDRAWN BOOKPLATE WASFOUND WHICH CONSISTED OF A SHIELD HALF RED AND HALF WHITE AND UPON ITA KEY PLACED IN PALE COUNTERCHARGED. THERE IS NO INSCRIPTION ON THISBOOKPLATE NOR IS THERE ANY MARGIN SHOWNTHE PAPER BEING CUT CLOSE TOTHE DESIGN.JOST AMMAN IS ANOTHER GERMAN ARTIST WHO LEAVES US IN A DIFFICULTY AS TODECIDING AS TO WHICH OF HIS MANY ARMORIAL ENGRAVINGS WERE REALLYINTENDED FOR BOOKPLATES. ONE UNDOUBTED BOOKPLATE BY HIM HOWEVEREXISTS AND THIS WAS DESIGNED FOR A MEMBER OF THE NUREMBERG FAMILY OFHOLZSCHUHERWOODEN SHOES. WOODEN SHOES OR SABOTS APPEAR AS CHARGESON THE SHIELD AND AFFORD ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE PUNNING HERALDRY WHICHWAS THEN FASHIONABLE IN GERMANY. THIS IS A FINE BOOKPLATE ENGRAVED ONCOPPER AND SIGNED J. A. ITS SIZE    INCHES. THE SHIELDIS SUPPORTED BY TWO ANGELS AND A LION.HANS SIBMACHER OR SIEBMACHER WAS ANOTHER NUREMBERG ENGRAVER HE WORKEDTHERE QUITE AT THE CLOSE OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY AND IN THE EARLY YEARSOF THE SEVENTEENTH. HE ALSO EXECUTED A BOOKPLATE FOR A MEMBER OF THEHOLZSCHUHER FAMILY. THIS IS A MORE ELABORATE PIECE OF WORK THAN AMMANSTHOUGH SMALLER    INCHES. ITS CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE IS ACLOSELYWOVEN WREATH OF LEAVES WITH CLUSTERS OF FRUIT AND ORNAMENTSINTRODUCED AT INTERVALS. SEATED ON THIS WREATH AT THE TOP OF THEDESIGN ARE TWO READING CHERUBS CLOTHED IN NATURE UNADORNED. BELOW THEDESIGN IS AN OBLONG AND INDENTED BRACKET.HANS TROSCHELS WORK AS A BOOKPLATE ENGRAVER IS ILLUSTRATED BY THEBOOKPLATE OF YET ANOTHER NUREMBERG MANJOHN WILLIAM KRESS OFKRESSENSTAIN DATED IN . IN THIS WE ARE SHOWN A SHIELD SET IN ANOVAL WREATH OF LEAFWORK. THE HELMET WHICH SURMOUNTS IT DISPLAYS SOMEELABORATE WORK FINELYCUT MANTLING EXTENDS ITSELF FROM THIS ON THERIGHT SIDE AND ON THE LEFT AND ABOVE IS A CORNET WHICH ENCIRCLES THECREST. THE WHOLE IS ENCLOSED IN A CIRCLE OF LEAVES AND BERRIES SOMEWHATSIMILAR TO THAT JUST DESCRIBED IN SPEAKING OF SIBMACHERS WORK BUTOUTSIDE THIS AT EACH OF THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE PLATE ARE SMALLSHIELDS SURMOUNTED BY HELMETS AND CRESTS AND CONTAINING THE ARMS OF THEFOUR FAMILIES FROM WHICH HE IMMEDIATELY DESCENDED THEIR NAMES BEINGGIVEN. NESTLING AMONGST THE MANTLING ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE DESIGN IS ADISTINCT SHIELD ON WHICH ARE DEPICTED THE ARMS OF SUSANNA KOLER WIFEOF THE OWNER OF THE BOOKPLATE.WOLFFGANG KILIAN BORN  DIED  WAS AN AUGSBURG MAN AND THEBOOKPLATE WHICH BEARS HIS SIGNATURE AND THE DATE  IS THAT OF ANAUGSBURG CHURCH DIGNITARYSEBASTIAN MYLLER SUFFRAGANBISHOP OFADRAMYTTEUM AND CANON OF AUGSBURG. IN ITS ORNAMENTATION IT BEARS SOMERESEMBLANCE TO AN ENGLISH JACOBEAN BOOKPLATE. ABOVE THE SHIELD IS THEHEAD OF A CHERUB ON WHICH THE EPISCOPAL MITRE IS MADE TO REST IN ASOMEWHAT COMICAL MANNER THE CHERUBS WINGS PROTRUDE OVER THE TOP OFAND INTO THE SHIELD. THE INSCRIPTION IS CONTAINED IN AN OVAL BANDOUTSIDE THIS IS AN OVAL LEAFWREATH AND OUTSIDE THIS AGAIN AN INDENTEDFRAME. WOLFFGANG WAS A YOUNGER BROTHER OF THE MORE NOTED LUCAS KILIAN.BOTH BROTHERS STUDIED AT VENICE AND WERE PUPILS OF THEIR STEPFATHERDOMINICK CUSTOS WHO WAS HIMSELF A DESIGNER OF BOOKPLATES.OF GILES SADELERS WORKTHE COUNT OF ROSENBERGS BOOKPLATEI SHALLSPEAK DIRECTLY PP.  . AN EXAMPLE OF HIS NEPHEWS ENGRAVING ISAFFORDED BY THE BOOKPLATE OF FERDINAND VON HAGENAU DATED IN .IN LATER TIMESTHE EIGHTEENTH CENTURYOTHER DISTINGUISHED GERMANARTISTS STOOPED TO BOOKPLATE ENGRAVING.

HIS BOOKPLATES ARE PROBABLY FEW ONLYFOUR OR FIVE ARE KNOWN. ONE OF THE MOST ELABORATE IN DESIGN IS THAT OF AGERMAN DOCTOR OF MEDICINE DATED IN  NINE YEARS BEFORE THE ARTISTSDEATH.IN THIS EXAMPLE MUCH OF THE SENSATIONAL STYLE OF THE GENERALITY OF HISWORK MANIFESTS ITSELF. THE BOOKPLATE SAYS LORD DE TABLEY IN ITSMOTIVE REMINDS US MUCH OF THOSE ALLEGORIC FRAMED CERTIFICATES OFMEMBERSHIP WHICH VARIOUS SICK CLUBS AND BENEFIT SOCIETIES ACCORD TOTHEIR MEMBERS AT THE PRESENT DAY.

SCHINTZ CALLS TO MIND A SOMEWHAT EARLIER GERMANEXAMPLE ENGRAVED BY BOETIUS FROM A DESIGN BY WERNERIN WHOSE SIGNATUREAPPEARS ON SOME VARIETIES OF THE PLATE ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE LASTCENTURY.

ASKELETON SITS UPON A COFFIN OR A COFFINSHAPED TOMB HOLDING IN HISRIGHT HAND A PAIR OF SCALES AND IN HIS LEFT A SCYTHE IN THE LIGHTERBALANCE OF THE SCALES IS A SCROLL BEARING THE INSCRIPTION DAN. V.

THE FORMER PARTICULARLY EXAMPLES OFTHE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY ARE ORNATE AND WELL DESIGNED.TAKE FOR INSTANCE THE REALLY MAGNIFICENT BOOKPLATE OF PETER VOKURSINUS COUNT OF ROSENBERG DATED . IT IS ENGRAVED ON COPPER ANDMEASURES  INCHES BY . IN A CENTRAL CIRCULAR MEDALLION  INCHESIN DIAMETER IS DEPICTED THE OWNER ARRAYED IN ARMOUR AND SEATED ON ARICHLY CAPARISONED WARHORSE PLUMED AND GOING AT FULL SPEED ACROSS ALANDSCAPE OF HILLOCKS.

WITH THE INSCRIPTION WHICH ISAPPROPRIATELY POMPOUS I NEED NOT TROUBLE THE READER BUT I HAVE THOUGHTIT WORTH WHILE TO GIVE HERE FOLLOWING LORD DE TABLEYS EXAMPLE ANDUSING SOMETIMES HIS WORDS A VERY FULL VERBAL PICTURE OF THIS TRULYMAGNIFICENT BOOKPLATE IN ORDER THAT THE PITCH OF ELABORATION TO WHICHA GERMAN BOOKPLATE CAN BE CARRIED MAY BE UNDERSTOOD. SUFFICE IT TO ADDTHAT THIS WORK OF ART WAS ENGRAVED BY GILES SADELER THE ANTWERPBORNENGRAVER WHO AFTER STUDYING IN ITALY WAS INVITED BY THE EMPERORRUDOLPH II. TO ENTER HIS SERVICE AT PRAGUE IN SHORT TO BECOME WHAT HESTYLES HIMSELF IN HIS SIGNATURE TO THIS BOOKPLATEENGRAVER TO HISIMPERIAL MAJESTY.LESS ELABORATE YET VERY BEAUTIFULLY ENGRAVED ARE THE BOOKPLATES USEDIN THE ELECTORAL LIBRARY OF THE DUKES OF BAVARIA AT MUNICH. ON ONEDATED IN  THE LARGEST VARIETY OF WHICH IS  INCHES HIGH AND BROAD WE HAVE THE ARMS OF THE DUCHY ENCLOSED BY THE COLLAR OF THEGOLDEN FLEECE. WINGED CARYATIDES SUPPORT THE ELECTORAL CROWN WHILSTBELOW IS AN ARABESQUED PLATFORM ON WHICH IS THE INSCRIPTION EXBIBLIOTHECA SERENISSIMORUM UTRIUSQUE BAVARI DUCUM . A SMALLERVARIETY OF THIS PLATE IS FIGURED OPPOSITE. SOME TWENTY YEARS LATER ASTILL LARGER AND MORE ORNATE BOOKPLATE    INCHES WAS DESIGNED FORUSE IN THE SAME LIBRARY. HERE THE ARMS ARE IN AN OVAL FRAME SURROUNDEDBY THE GOLDEN FLEECE ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT ARE INVERTED CORNUCOPI ANDTHE CROWN IS HELD ALOFT BY FOUR CHERUBS. ALL THE BOOKPLATES OF THISLIBRARY EXIST IN A GREAT VARIETY OF DESIGN AND NEARLY ALL THE VARIETIESARE FOUND IN DIFFERENT SIZES.ILLUSTRATIONTHESE EXAMPLES ARE TYPICAL OF MANY OTHER GERMAN BOOKPLATES THECONCEPTION OF THE DESIGN IS EXCELLENT AND ITS WORKING OUT IS EQUALLYGOOD. IN LATER TIMES THE WORK ON BOOKPLATES PERHAPS DETERIORATEDBECAUSE IT FELL TO A LARGE EXTENT INTO INFERIOR HANDS. YET GERMANYCAN SHOW SEVERAL VERY CREDITABLE EXAMPLES IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.SOME OF THOSE WHICH GIVE THE VIEW OF A LIBRARY INTERIOR ARE DECIDEDLYPLEASING THEY APPEAR SOON AFTER THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE CENTURY. THELIBRARIES REPRESENTED HAVE USUALLY ONE OR MORE MYTHOLOGICAL INMATESBUT IN ONE INSTANCE THE OWNER IS IN POSSESSION AND IS SEEN HARD ATWORK AMONGST HIS VOLUMES.IN CONCLUDING THIS CHAPTER IT MAY BE NOTED THAT EXAMPLES OFNAMETICKETS ARE FOUND IN GERMANY AS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. PERHAPS THEEARLIEST IS ONE FIRST NOTICED I BELIEVE BY MR. WEALE IN A COPY ATTHE BODLEIAN LIBRARY OF A GERMAN PSALTER PRINTED AT AUGSBURG IN .THIS READS SUM MAGISTRI GEORGII MAYRII MONACENCIS I.E. OF MUNICHWITH THE MOTTO MELIUS EST PRO VERITATE PATI SUPPLICIUM QUAM PROADULATIONE CONSEQUI BENEFICIUM. THE SAME INSCRIPTION HAS BEEN WRITTENIN INK ON THE TITLEPAGE WITH THE ADDED DATE  AND AFTERWARDSNODOUBT A FEW YEARS LATER WHEN THE LABEL WAS PRINTED AND PLACED IN THEBOOKCROSSED THROUGH.THE MOST COMPLETE WORK ON GERMAN BOOKPLATES THAT HAS YET MADE ITSAPPEARANCE IS HERR WARNECKES DIE DEUTSCHEN BCHERZEICHEN BERLIN BUT A WORK PROPERLY CLASSIFYING THE DIFFERENT STYLES OF GERMANBOOKPLATES AND AFFIXING TO THESE STYLES COVERING DATES HAS YET TO BEWRITTEN.CHAPTER VIITHE BOOKPLATES OF FRANCE AND OTHER COUNTRIESFRANCE SO FAR AS A GENERALLY DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT OF HER BOOKPLATES ISCONCERNED IS CERTAINLY MORE FORTUNATE THAN HER NEIGHBOUR GERMANY.FRENCH BOOKPLATES RECEIVED ATTENTION IN THE SHAPE OF A CAPITAL WORKUPON THEM BEFORE THOSE OF ANY OTHER COUNTRY WERE SIMILARLY HONOURED. M.POULET MALASSISS LES EX LIBRIS FRANAIS MADE ITS FIRST APPEARANCE IN AND BEARS EVIDENT TESTIMONY TO THE FACT THAT THE AUTHOR HAD FORMANY YEARS PREVIOUSLY MADE AN ATTENTIVE STUDY OF HIS NATIVE BOOKPLATES.SINCE THE APPEARANCE OF M. POULET MALASSISS WORK BOOKPLATE COLLECTINGIN FRANCE AS WELL AS IN OTHER COUNTRIES HAS BEEN VIGOROUSLY CARRIEDON AND EARLIER EXAMPLES OF DATED FRENCH BOOKPLATES THAN THOSE THENKNOWN HAVE COME TO LIGHT. THE MOST ANCIENT OF THESE IS ONE DATED THE SAME YEAR IT WILL BE NOTED AS THAT OF THE PLATE OF SIR NICHOLASBACON BUT IT IS SIMPLY TYPOGRAPHICAL HAVING NO KIND OF DESIGNWHATEVER. IT READS EX BIBLIOTHECA CAROLI ALBOSII E. EDUENSIS. EXLABORE QUIES. NO ARMORIAL BOOKPLATE BEARING AN ENGRAVED DATE APPEARSIN FRANCE UNTIL THIRTYSEVEN YEARS LATER WHEN WE AT LAST MEET WITHTHAT OF ALEXANDRE BOUCHART VICOMTE DE BLOSSVILLE ENGRAVED BY LONARDGAULTIER AND IN THE COPY IN THE BIBLIOTHQUE NATIONALE DATED . AVARIETY OF THIS BOOKPLATE UNDATED UNSIGNED AND PROBABLY NOT BY THESAME HAND EXISTS IN THE COLLECTION OF SIR WOLLASTON FRANKS. THE FIELDIN THE BOUCHART ARMS IS GULES THOUGH THE LINES SHOWN IN THE ENGRAVINGOF THE UNDATED PLATE WOULD ACCORDING TO THE PRESENT SYSTEM REPRESENTIT AS AZURE SEE REMARKS ON THIS POINT AT P. . AFTER THE BOUCHARTBOOKPLATE WE HAVE IN  THAT OF MELCHIOR DE LA VALLE CANON OFNANCY GIVEN BY M. POULET MALASSIS AS DATED IN  AND THEN IN A ROUGHLYEXECUTED ANONYMOUS BOOKPLATE SIGNED RAIGNIAULD RIOMI .THE ARMS ARE UNTINCTURED AND LEAFLIKE MANTLING FALLING FROM THE HELMETSURROUNDS THE SHIELD THERE IS NO CREST. RAIGNIAULDOR AS THE MODERNSPELLING OF THE NAME IS REGNAULTIS NOT A KNOWN ENGRAVER. RIOMI IS ANOLDFASHIONED TOWN OF AUVERGNE.OTHER FRENCH BOOKPLATES OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY BOTH DATED ANDUNDATED EXIST BUT FRANCE IS UNDENIABLY BEHIND GERMANY BOTH IN THENUMBER OF HER EARLY BOOKPLATES AND IN THEIR BEAUTY FOR INSTANCE WE DONOT IN FRANCE FIND THOSE NUMEROUS BOOKPLATES OF ECCLESIASTICALCORPORATIONS WHICH SO MUCH SWELL THE LIST OF EARLY GERMAN EXAMPLES. THESUBJECT OF FRENCH ECCLESIASTICAL BOOKPLATES HAS INDEED RECEIVEDSPECIAL TREATMENT FROM FATHER INGOLD HIMSELF A FRENCH ECCLESIASTIC ANDHE IS COMPELLED TO ADMIT THAT SUCH BOOKPLATES ARE NOT NUMEROUS AND NOTANCIENT. THE OLD WAY SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN FOR THE MONASTIC OFFICIAL INCHARGE OF THE CONVENT LIBRARY TO INSCRIBE EACH VOLUME WITH SOMEAPPROPRIATE INSCRIPTION. THESE ARE IN THEMSELVES INTERESTING BUTBOOKPLATE LOVERS MUST REGRET THE EXISTENCE OF THE FASHION. THE EARLIESTFRENCH ECCLESIASTICAL BOOKPLATES BELONG TO THE MIDDLE OF THE EIGHTEENTHCENTURY AND LIKE THE  EXAMPLE ALREADY NOTICED THEY ARE MERETYPOGRAPHICAL LABELS POSSESSING LITTLE MORE ARTISTIC MERIT THAN ISUSUALLY DISPLAYED IN A POSTMARK.WITH REGARD HOWEVER TO THE BOOKPLATES OF ECCLESIASTICAL INDIVIDUALSTHE CASE IS DIFFERENT SOME OF THEM ENGRAVED DURING THE SEVENTEENTHCENTURY ARE AMBITIOUS AND INTERESTING. A PARTICULARLY QUAINT EXAMPLE ISFOUND IN THE BOOKPLATE WHICH AN ANNECY ENGRAVER NAMED SINTON EXECUTEDFOR CHARLES DE SALES THE ENERGETIC LABOURER IN THE CAUSE OF RELIGIONBROTHER OF ST. FRANCIS DE SALES AND HIS SUCCESSOR IN THE BISHOPRIC OFANNECY. LORD DE TABLEY THUS DESCRIBES THE BOOKPLATETHE FAMILY ARMSARE SHOWN IN A SHIELD WHICH APPEARS VERY GIGANTIC IN A FRAME OF HEAVYCURVES WHICH IS SET IN THE CENTRE OF A HUGE SIDEBOARDLIKE MONUMENTALSTRUCTURE. ON THE TOP LEDGES OF THIS TWO FULLGROWN LONGSKIRTEDANGELS SEATED RIGHT AND LEFT UPHOLD THE EPISCOPAL HAT WITH ITS USUALKNOTTED ROPES AND TASSELS IN AIR ABOVE THE ESCUTCHEON.AT THE BASE OF THE STRUCTURE TO THE RIGHT APPEARS A FIGURE OF ST.FRANCIS DE SALES SEATED HOLDING AN OLIVE BRANCH IN ONE HAND WHILEBENEATH HIS OTHER ARM IS A PROFUSE CLUSTER OF FRUIT. TO THE LEFT ALSOSEATED IS A PORTRAIT OF ST. JANE FRANCES DE CHANTAL HOLDING APALMBRANCH ALSO WITH FRUIT BENEATH HER OTHER ARM. EACH PORTRAIT ISREALISTIC AND NOT IN THE LEAST FLATTERED. BETWEEN THEM IS A MEDALLIONBEARING THE CROSSED PAPAL KEYS.THE PROBABLE DATE OF THIS VERY CURIOUS BOOKPLATE IS . IT APPEARSEARLIER BUT THIS MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE FACT THAT THE WORK ISPROVINCIAL. STUDENTS WILL DO WELL TO REMEMBER THAT PROVINCIALLY EXECUTEDBOOKPLATES ENGLISH OR FOREIGN ARE OFTEN MISLEADING IN THIS RESPECT.THERE IS A SOMEWHAT ELABORATE BOOKPLATE ENGRAVED IN SEVERAL SIZES ANDDATED IN  WHICH INTRODUCES THE CARDINALS HAT MITRE AND CROZIERAND WHICH WAS PREPARED TO PLACE IN THE BOOKS GIVEN BY DR. PETER DANIELHUET TO THE PARIS JESUITS. HUET IS HIMSELF AN INTERESTING FIGURE INFRENCH LITERATURE. IN  HE WAS MADE TUTOR TO THE DAUPHIN AND WHILSTSO EMPLOYED HE ASSISTED IN BRINGING OUT THE SIXTYTWO VOLUMES OFCLASSICS SPECIALLY PREPARED FOR HIS PUPIL KNOWN AS THE DELPHINEDITION. HE BECAME BISHOP OF AVRANCHES IN  BUT TEN YEARS AFTERRESIGNED HIS SEE IN ORDER TO DEVOTE THE REMAINDER OF HIS LIFE TOLITERATURE WHICH HE DID COMPLETING AMONGST OTHER VOLUMINOUS WORKS ADEFENCE OF THE DOCTRINE OF CHRISTIANITY.ILLUSTRATION BOOKPLATE OF CHARLES DE SALES.IT IS FROM THEIR POSSESSORS THAT FRENCH BOOKPLATES DERIVE THEIR CHIEFINTEREST AND THESE POSSESSORS ARE FOR THE MOST PART PERSONS WHO LIVEDAT A LATE DATE. AMONGST THE FEW EARLY CELEBRITIES IS THE SOLDIERPOET OFFRANCE FRANCIS DE MALHERBE OF WHOM IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT HE WAS AS LAXIN MORALS AS HE WAS RIGID IN HIS ZEAL FOR THE PURITY OF HIS NATIVELANGUAGE. HIS BOOKPLATE IS FIGURED AT P.  AND IS INTERESTING ASSHOWING THAT NO RELIANCE CAN BE PLACED ON LINES APPARENTLY EXPRESSINGTHE COLOUR OF THE SHIELD IN EARLY ARMORIAL BOOKPLATES SEE PP. .HE DIED IN . THE BOOKS CONTAINING THIS VERY PLEASING BOOKPLATEPASSED AFTER DE MALHERBES DEATH TO VINCENT DE BOYER IN WHOSE FAMILYTHEY REMAINED TILL THE REVOLUTION AFTER THAT THEY WERE DISPERSED.COMING TO LATER TIMES WE FIND A CHARMING BOOKPLATE ENGRAVED BY LEGRAND FOR THE UNFORTUNATE COUNTESS DUBARRY. HER BOOKS WERE WELL CHOSENAND WELL BOUND BUT THEY WERE FEW IN NUMBER HENCE HER BOOKPLATE ISRARE BUT IT MAY BE SEEN IN THE LIBRARY AT VERSAILLES WHERE MOST OF HERBOOKS ARE PRESERVED. THOUGH SHE COULD NOT READ SHE SEEMS TO HAVE FELTIN DUTY BOUND TO FOLLOW LA POMPADOUR IN GETTING TOGETHER A LIBRARY TOAMUSE HER ROYAL MASTER.FROM THE BOOKPLATE OF THE COUNTESSA WOMAN WHO AFTER AIDING IN THEGENERAL DEGRADATION OF THE FRENCH COURT WAS WILLING TO RISK HER LIFEFOR THOSE WHOSE DOWNFALL SHE HAD IN A MEASURE ASSISTED IN BRINGINGABOUTWE MAY APPROPRIATELY TURN TO THAT OF CARDINAL MAURY THEINSCRIPTION ON WHICH READS BIBLIOTHQUE PARTICULIRE DE SON EMINENCEMGR. LE CARDINAL MAURY. THIS BOOKPLATE CALLS TO MIND A FAMOUS FIGUREIN THE FRENCH REVOLUTIONA FERVENT PREACHER THE SPOKESMAN OF HISFELLOWCLERGY BEFORE THOSE WHO WERE BUT LITTLE INCLINED TO LISTEN TOARGUMENT THE CALMMINDED MAN WHO WOULD TURN ROUND AND GIVE A WITTYRETORT TO A CRY RAISED BY THE MOB WHICH FOLLOWED THROUGH THE STREETS OFPARIS CLAMOURING FOR HIS BLOOD.THE MENTION OF THESE NAMES LEADS ONE NATURALLY TO SPEAK GENERALLY OFBOOKPLATES ENGRAVED ABOUT THE TIME OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTIONA PERIODWHICH IS IMMORTALISED IN A SINGULAR MANNER ON FRENCH BOOKPLATES. M.POULET MALASSIS REMARKS THAT MANY A NOBLE LIBRARY OWNER TOOK GOOD CARETO ALTER HIS BOOKPLATE IN THOSE TROUBLESOME TIMES AND TO REPLACE THECORONET WHICH HAD SURMOUNTED THE FAMILY ESCUTCHEON BY THE PHRYGIAN CAPOF LIBERTY. FOR INSTANCE THE VISCOUNT DE BORBONBUSSET IN  CHANGEDHIS ARMORIAL BOOKPLATE TO A SIMPLE INSCRIPTIONIN WHICH HE CALLSHIMSELF CITOYEN FRANOISSURROUNDED BY A LEAFY GARLAND. THE SAMEFASHION IS EXEMPLIFIED EVEN IN CLERICAL EXAMPLES. FATHER LE MERCIER INHIS FIRST BOOKPLATE DISPLAYS THE CORONET WHICH HE EITHER WAS OR ATLEAST CONSIDERED HIMSELF TO BE ENTITLED TO BEAR BUT BETWEEN  AND WE FIND A SECOND EXAMPLE OF HIS BOOKPLATE WITH A SIMPLEDECORATIVE FINISH TO THE TOP OF THE DESIGN IN LIEU OF THE CORONET. ATTHAT TIME THERE WAS IN FRANCE AS MR. WALTER HAMILTON PUTS IT ANAWKWARD FASHION OF PUTTING HEADS ACCUSTOMED TO CORONETS UNDER THEFALLING KNIFE OF THE GUILLOTINE.AS FAR AS THE CLASSIFYING OF THE LEADING STYLES IN FRENCH BOOKPLATESGOES M. POULET MALASSIS DOES NOT REALLY HELP US MUCH AND WE CANNOT BUTHOPE THAT ERE LONG SOME ENTERPRISING FRENCH COLLECTOR WILL UNDERTAKE THETASK. THERE IS CERTAINLY AS M. POULET MALASSIS OBSERVES ARESEMBLANCEAS THE READER WILL SEE BY TURNING BACK TO THE ILLUSTRATIONOF DE MALHERBES BOOKPLATEBETWEEN THE STYLE OF THE FIRST FRENCHBOOKPLATES AND THAT OF THE FIRST ENGLISH AND IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT THESTYLE DISAPPEARED IN BOTH COUNTRIES MUCH AT THE SAME TIME. AGAIN FRENCHBOOKPLATES OF  BEAR DISTINCT TRACES OF WHAT WE HAVE CALLEDJACOBEAN WORK IN SPEAKING OF ENGLISH EXAMPLES.THE FRENCH ROCOCO BOOKPLATE IS REALLY ANALOGOUS TO OUR CHIPPENDALE.THERE IS HOWEVER A GREATER VARIETY BOTH OF SUBJECT AND TREATMENT INEACH FRENCH STYLE THAN ONE FINDS IN ENGLAND.ALLEGORY IS AS I STATED IN CHAPTER IV. MORE FREQUENT AND MORE WILD INFRENCH BOOKPLATES THAN IN THOSE OF ENGLAND. THE FOLLIES OF HIS OWNCOUNTRYMEN IN THIS RESPECT ARE FULLY RECOGNISED BY M. POULET MALASSISWHO IN MOST AMUSING STYLE DEALS WITH SOME OF THE MORE PRONOUNCEDEXAMPLES AS FOR INSTANCE THE ROLLICKING ALLEGORY DISPLAYED IN THEBOOKPLATE OF M. HNAULT PRESIDENT OF THE FRENCH ACADEMY. THE DATE OFTHIS REMARKABLE PRODUCTION MAY BE FIXED AT  IT IS DESIGNED BYBOUCHER AND ENGRAVED BY COUNT DE CAYLUS AND WE SEE THAT MINERVA HASHONOURED M. LE PRSIDENT BY PLACING HIS FAMILY ARMS UPON HER SHIELD.VERY WONDERFUL TOO IS THE BOOKPLATE OF THE ABB DE GRICOURT WHOSEARMS ARE BORNE HEAVENWARDS BY A VAST COMPANY OF ANGELS. THIS EXAMPLEWHICH IS APPROXIMATELY OF THE SAME DATE AS THE LAST IS THE WORK OF THEABBS BROTHER A. T. CEYS WHO WAS HIMSELF AN ECCLESIASTIC. OFTEN THEALLEGORY DISPLAYED HAS ALLUSION TO THE OWNERS BUSINESS OR HIS TASTESAS ON THAT OF M. GUEULLETTE A FRENCH NOVELIST AND DRAMATIST OF THEFIRST HALF OF THE LAST CENTURY THE POPULARITY OF WHOSE WRITINGSALTHOUGH THOSE WRITINGS ARE NUMEROUS HAS NOT OUTLIVED HIM. THISBOOKPLATE IS THE WORK OF H. BECAT AND IS INSCRIBED AFTER THEPIRCKHEIMER MANNER EX LIBRIS THOM GUEULLETTE ET AMICORUM. THE FAMILYARMS ARE SUPPORTED BY AN ITALIAN HARLEQUIN A CHINESE MANDARIN ACYCLOPS HOLDING AN INFANT AND A TARTAR. NOW THE PRESENCE OF THESESTRANGE INHABITANTS OF A BOOKPLATE IS ACCOUNTED FOR THUS. GUEULLETTEWROTE FARCES FOR THE PARIS STAGE AND HE ALSO WROTE CONTES TARTARESAND LES AVENTURES DU MANDARIN FUM HOAM. BELOW THE SHIELD WATER POURSFROM A SATYRS MOUTH INTO A BASIN CONTAINING A MERMAID AND ABOVE SOARSCUPID IN CLOUDS BEARING ALOFT A SCROLL AND MOTTO. THIS SAYS W. H. INTHE EX LIBRIS JOURNAL IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE EARLIEST BOOKPLATES ONWHICH APPEAR ALLEGORIC ALLUSIONS TO ITS OWNERS TASTES AND LITERARYLABOURS.THE TYPICAL OR PERSONAL BOOKPLATE IS ALSO FOUND IN FRANCE IN THATOF THE CHEVALIER DE FLEURIEU DESCRIBED BY MR. EGERTON CASTLE. DURINGTHE ANCIEN RGIME HE WAS A NAVAL OFFICER WHO WHILST STILL LOW IN THESERVICE WAS INTRUSTED WITH THE TESTING OF VARIOUS NEW MARINEAPPLIANCES. ON THE BOOKPLATE WE GET THE BIRDSEYE VIEW OF AN ISLANDON WHICH ARE STREWN THE SAID MARINE APPLIANCES AND BEHIND THEM STANDSTHE CHEVALIERS COAT OF ARMS.A RECENT WRITER ON FRENCH BOOKPLATES M. HENRI BOUCHOT GOES SO FAR ASTO THINK A BOOKPLATE MAY BE OF SERVICE AS EXHIBITING A MANS CHARACTER.IT MAY BE SO WITH REGARD TO FRENCHMEN AND FRENCH BOOKPLATES BUT IFTHIS PRINCIPLE OF ARGUMENT BE APPLIED TO ENGLISH BOOKPLATES ALL I CANSAY IS THAT THE POSSESSORS OF ENGLISH BOOKPLATES IN THE CLOSING YEARSOF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY AND THE OPENING YEARS OF THE EIGHTEENTH MUSTHAVE BEEN SINGULARLY ALIKE IN THEIR PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICSILLUSTRATIONTHE LIBRARY INTERIOR BOOKPLATE IS FOUND IN FRANCE AS EARLY AS IN AN ANONYMOUS BOOKPLATE DESCRIBED BY MR. WALTER HAMILTON IN THE BOOKWORM FOR MAY . IT SHOWS US IN THE BACKGROUND OF A LIBRARY TWO MENWORKING A PRINTINGPRESS. IN THE FOREGROUND ARE FIVE LITTLE WINGEDCUPIDS AT PLAY WITH BOOKS AND MATHEMATICAL INSTRUMENTS WHILST A FEMALEFIGURE REPRESENTING PEACE AND PLENTY APPEARS SEATED ON WHAT MR.HAMILTON CONJECTURES TO BE A PEGASUS. THE ENGRAVING IS BY BERNARDPICART AN EMINENT ENGRAVER WHO THOUGH A FRENCHMAN BY BIRTH SETTLEDAT AMSTERDAM IN  HE DIED IN  AND WAS EVIDENTLY MUCH INFLUENCEDBY THE THEN PREVAILING STYLE IN DUTCH ART. HE EXECUTED ANOTHER VERYBEAUTIFUL LIBRARY INTERIOR PLATE FIGURED OPPOSITE FOR AMADEUSLULIN A SAVOYARD. HERE WE HAVE THE INTERIOR OF A FRENCH LIBRARY OF THEPERIOD WITH A CURVED ROOF. AT THE END OF THE ROOM IS A WINDOW ANDBENEATH THIS A LOUIS XV. TABLE. IN THE FOREGROUND THE SAME CUPIDS PLAYWITH BOOKS WHICH BY THE WAY THEY ARE TREATING EXCEEDINGLY BADLY.CARYATIDES AT THE SIDES FORM A FRAME FOR THE PLATE. ON THE BREAST OF ONEIS A SUN THE OTHER HOLDS A HEART. A GLOBE SURMOUNTS EACH. THE ARMS ARESHOWN IN THE CENTRE OF THE DESIGN AT THE TOP.OTHER EXAMPLES OF FRENCH BOOKPLATES OF THIS KIND ARE FOUND QUITE LATEIN THE CENTURY AND ANY ONE WHO FEELS SPECIALLY INTERESTED IN THESUBJECT OF THESE AND INDEED OF LIBRARY INTERIOR BOOKPLATES AS AWHOLE WILL DO WELL TO STUDY SIR ARTHUR VICARSS VALUABLE TREATISE ANDLISTS IN THE PAGES OF THE EX LIBRIS JOURNAL.ABOUT THE BOOKPLATES OF COUNTRIES OTHER THAN GERMANY AND FRANCE THEREIS NOT VERY MUCH TO BE SAID. SWEDEN HAS GIVEN US AN INSIGHT INTO ITSNATIVE BOOKPLATES. HERR CARLANDER TELLS US THAT THE EARLIEST DATE ONA SWEDISH BOOKPLATE IS  WHICH OCCURS ON THAT BELONGING TO THUREBIELKE A SENATOR WHO HAVING MIXED HIMSELF UP IN POLITICAL STRIFE LOSTHIS HEAD BY A STROKE OF THE EXECUTIONERS AXE FIVE YEARS LATER. SENATORBIELKE WAS EVIDENTLY FAR IN ADVANCE OF HIS FELLOWCOUNTRYMEN AS REGARDSSUCH MATTERS FOR NO OTHER DATED SWEDISH BOOKPLATE OCCURS FOR ACONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF YEARS. IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY HOWEVERSWEDISH BOOKPLATES BECAME MUCH MORE NUMEROUS AND SOME OF THE MOREPROMINENT NATIVE ENGRAVERS APPEAR TO HAVE WORKED UPON THEM PRODUCING AFEW SINGULARLY FINE EXAMPLES IN THE ROCOCO STYLE LIBRARY INTERIORSALSO APPEAR OCCASIONALLY ON SWEDISH BOOKPLATES. ONE OF THE MOSTINTERESTING LATE EXAMPLES OF BOOKPLATES OF THIS COUNTRY IS THAT OF KINGCHARLES XIII. ON THIS WE HAVE THE ROYAL ARMS OF SWEDEN SURMOUNTED BYTHE COLLAR AND CROSS OF THE ORDER OF THE SERAPHIM AND THE KINGS MOTTOFOLKETS WL MINT HOGSTA LAGTHE PEOPLES WEAL MY HIGHEST LAW. IIMAGINE THAT THIS BOOKPLATE MAY BE PLACED AT THE CLOSE OF THE LASTCENTURY. CHARLES DIED IN .SWISS BOOKPLATES ARE NUMEROUS AND EARLY. THE FIRST DATED EXAMPLE OCCURSIN . THEIR GENERAL STYLE IS NOT PLEASING SINCE IT PRESENTS ASTIFFNESS AND AWKWARDNESS IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE DECORATION. ITALIANBOOKPLATES AGAIN POSSESS FEW REMARKABLE FEATURES. PERHAPS THEIRLEADING CHARACTERISTIC IS THE EXTREME COLDNESS OF THEIR ENGRAVERSTOUCH. ONE OF THESE ENGRAVERS WAS HOWEVER A FAMOUS MAN WHOSE WORKDESERVES MORE THAN PASSING MENTION. I MEAN RAPHAEL MORGHEN THEFLORENTINE ARTIST WHO DIED IN  AND WHO IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN ABLETO ENGRAVE A PLATE WHEN HE WAS ONLY TWELVE YEARS OLD. IT IS CURIOUS TOTURN FROM HIS LARGE ENGRAVINGS OF THE CHIEF WORKS IN THE GALLERY ATFLORENCE TO THE UNUSUALLY SMALL WORK WHICH ENABLES US TO RECKON HIMHERE AMONG THE ENGRAVERS OF BOOKPLATES. THIS IS A REPRESENTATION OFTHE ARMS OF THE DUKE OF CASSANO SERRA FRAMED IN A SHELLY FRAMESOMEWHAT CHIPPENDALE IN APPEARANCE BUT WITH THE STIFF HEAVYJACOBEAN WREATH CLINGING CLOSELY TO IT. IN A SCROLL WHICH WINDS IN ANDOUT OF THIS WREATH IS THE INSCRIPTION IL DUCA CASSANO SERRA IT ISSIGNED R. MORGHEN FECIT.A CAREFUL INVESTIGATION OF THE VATICAN AND OTHER ITALIAN LIBRARIES WOULDPROBABLY LEAD TO THE DISCOVERY OF SOME MORE PAPAL BOOKPLATES. SIRWOLLASTON FRANKS TELLS ME THAT AMONGST HIS NUMEROUS ENGRAVINGS OF THEPAPAL ARMS THERE IS ONLY ONE WHICH HE FEELS SURE WAS EVER USED AS ABOOKPLATE. THE LATE SIR GEORGE DASENT IN NOTES AND QUERIESDESCRIBES WHAT HE CONSIDERS THE BOOKPLATE OF MAFFEO BARBERINI URBANVIII. BUT HE DOES NOT TELL US WHAT LEADS HIM TO THE BELIEF THAT THEENGRAVING IS REALLY A BOOKPLATE.ABOUT SPANISH BOOKPLATES NOT MUCH IS YET KNOWN AND IT SEEMS LIKELYTHAT THE MAJORITY OF EXAMPLES USUALLY CLASSED AS SPANISH WERE DESIGNEDAND EXECUTED IN FLANDERS. THE FAMILY OF BOUTTATSTHE ORIGINAL BOUTTATSHAD SAYS WALPOLE TWENTY SONS OF WHOM TWELVE BECAME ENGRAVERSEXECUTEDSOME OF THESE BOOKPLATES. AMONGST THEIR WORK IS ONE WHICH LORD DETABLEY STYLES A GLOOMY YET STRIKING HERALDIC STUDY IT IS SIGNED P.B. BOUTTATS SCULP. AND WAS PROBABLY ENGRAVED ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THESEVENTEENTH CENTURY. IT SHOWS US THE ARMS OF A BISHOP SURMOUNTED BY APLUMED HELMET ABOVE WHICH AGAIN IS A BISHOPS HAT WITH PENDENT ROPESAND TASSELS BENEATH IS THE MOTTO POR LA LE BEZERRA  POR EL RY.

P. .CHAPTER VIIIAMERICAN BOOKPLATESWHATEVER AN AMERICAN COLLECTS HE COLLECTS WELL HE WORKS WITH A WILLAND ENERGY THAT LOOSENS HIS PURSESTRINGS IN A MANNER WHICH MAKES THEACQUISITION OF VALUABLE SPECIMENS A COMPARATIVELY EASY MATTER. IT ISWELL THEREFORE THAT BOOKPLATE COLLECTING HAS FOUND ITS WAY OVER THEATLANTIC AND THAT THERE IS NOW A GOODLY BODY OF AMERICAN BOOKPLATECOLLECTORS WHO ARE GIVING THE REQUISITE AMOUNT OF ATTENTION TO AMERICANEXAMPLES AND WHO ARE NOT KEEPING TO THEMSELVES THE RESULT OF THEIRLABOURS. IN THE FIRST EDITION OF THIS BOOK I WROTE NO DOUBT TEN YEARSHENCE WE SHALL KNOW A GREAT DEAL MORE ABOUT AMERICAN BOOKPLATES ANDALREADY THE APPEARANCE OF MR. CHARLES DEXTER ALLENS INTERESTING ANDCAREFULLY COMPOSED ACCOUNT OF THEM HAS ENABLED ME MATERIALLY TO IMPROVETHIS CHAPTER WHICH I HAVE DEVOTED TO THEM.THE MAJORITY OF BOOKPLATES WHICH BEAR UPON THEM AMERICAN ADDRESSESESPECIALLY THOSE BELONGING TO THE SOUTHERN STATES MANY OF WHICH APPEARWITH THE OPENING OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY ARE WITHOUT DOUBT THE WORKOF ENGRAVERS IN THE THEN MOTHERCOUNTRY. THE LIBRARY OWNERS OFVIRGINIA SENT TO ENGLAND FOR THESE BOOKPLATES OR THEIR SONS ORDEREDTHEM THERE WHILST PAYING THE ORTHODOX VISIT TO ONE OF THE UNIVERSITIESAND BROUGHT THEM HOME EITHER FOR THEIR OWN USE OR FOR THE USE OF THEIRFATHERS. THE NORTHERN BOOKPLATES THOUGH MUCH LATER ARE MOSTLY THEWORK OF ARTISTS BORN AND BRED OR AT LEAST SETTLED IN AMERICA.FOREMOST IN INTEREST AND EARLIEST IN DATE OF THESE AMERICANADDRESSPLATES IS THAT OF WILLIAM PENN ON WHICH HE STYLES HIMSELFPROPRIETOR OF PENSYLVANIA. THIS IS DESIGNED IN THE ORDINARY SIMPLEARMORIAL STYLE THEN COMMON IN ENGLAND AND IS DATED IN . IT ISTHEREFORE SUBSEQUENT TO PENNS LAST VISIT TO HIS PLANTATION ANDCANNOT HAVE BEEN THE WORK OF AN ENGRAVER ON THAT SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC.AFTER HIS DEATH THE INSCRIPTION ON THIS BOOKPLATE WAS ALTERED FOR HISSONS USE TO THOMAS PENN OF STOKE POGEIS IN THE COUNTY OF BUCKSFIRST PROPRIETOR OF PENSILVANIA SIC. THE EXPRESSION FIRST MUSTHERE BE EVIDENTLY READ AS CHIEF OR PRINCIPAL. THE FACT OF THISALTERATION IS IMPORTANT FOR COLLECTORS TO NOTE AS COPIES OF WILLIAMPENNS BOOKPLATE ARE FREQUENTLY OFFERED FOR SALE WHICHTHEY AREPALPABLY RECENT IMPRESSIONSARE SAID TO BE STRUCK FROM THE ORIGINALPLATE A STATEMENT WHICH FROM THE FACT MENTIONED MAY BE AT ONCEDISCREDITED.NEXT IN POINT OF DATE IS A MUCH MORE ORNATE BOOKPLATE THE INSCRIPTIONON WHICH READS WILLIAM BYRD OF WESTOVER IN VIRGINIA ESQUIRE. IT ISAN ELABORATE PIECE OF WORK EXCELLENTLY ENGRAVED IN THE STYLE OF THEMAJORITY OF ENGLISH BOOKPLATES OF  OR THEREABOUTS SIMPLEARMORIAL BUT WITH INDICATIONS OF JACOBEAN DECORATION. WILLIAM BYRD WASBORN IN VIRGINIA TH MARCH  HE WAS SENT TO ENGLAND TO BEEDUCATED AND RETURNED TO HIS NATIVE COUNTRY HAVING HIS MIND STOREDWITH USEFUL INFORMATION TO ADORN ITS ANNALS HIS MANNERS CULTIVATED INROYAL COURTS AND WITH THIS BOOKPLATE AS A MARK OF HIS DEVOTION TOLITERATURE.THE FAMOUS WESTOVER MANSION WHICH MAY TODAY BE VIEWED FROM THE JAMESRIVER TWO HOURS SAIL BELOW RICHMOND WAS FOR LONG THE VICEREGAL COURTOF VIRGINIA. IT WAS ERECTED ABOUT THE YEAR  BY WILLIAM BYRD WHOLEFT ENGLAND WHEN VERY YOUNG AND WAS FATHER TO HIS NAMESAKE WHOSEBOOKPLATE HAS JUST BEEN DESCRIBED THE AUTHOR OF THE FAMOUS WESTOVERMANUSCRIPTS COMPILED IN .SOME FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE PROBABLE DATE OF THE BYRD BOOKPLATE WE HAVENOTE OF THAT BELONGING TO ROBERT ELLISTON GENT. COMPTROLR OF HISMAJESTIES CUSTOMS OF NEW YORK IN AMERICA MDCCXXV. THIS BOOKPLATE ISQUITE JACOBEAN IN STYLE AND WAS NO DOUBT EXECUTED IN ENGLAND ANDSENT OUT TO THE COLONY. IT IS TOO FINE A PIECE OF WORK TO BE THEPRODUCTION OF ANY COLONIAL ENGRAVER OF THAT DATE.BUT THE INTEREST ATTACHING TO BOOKPLATES BEARING UPON THEM AMERICANADDRESSES AND USED BY RESIDENTS IN AMERICA IS OBVIOUSLY NOT SO GREATAS THAT AWAKENED BY EXAMPLES WHICH WERE ALSO ACTUALLY PRODUCED INAMERICAEXAMPLES WHICH AT ONCE GIVE US AN INSIGHT INTO THE STATE OFTHE ENGRAVERS ART AND OF THE ARTISTIC FEELING THEN EXISTING THERE.THE EARLIEST OF THESE IS THE BOOKPLATE OF THE REV. JOHN WILLIAMSFIRST MINISTER OF DEERFIELD MASS. DATED IN . THE NEXT IN THAT OF THOMAS PRINCE AN AMERICAN BORN AND BRED WHO GRADUATED FROMHARVARD COLLEGE IN  AND PAID HIS FIRST VISIT TO ENGLAND IN  SOTHAT HIS BOOKPLATE MAY BE TAKEN AS GENUINELY AMERICAN. IN DESIGN ITRESEMBLES DOZENS OF ENGLISH EXAMPLESA ROUGH WOODCUT BORDER OFNATIONAL EMBLEMS WITHIN WHICH IS THE INSCRIPTION THOM PRINCE LIBERANNO DOMINI  THE SEQUENCE OF THE WORDS IN THE INSCRIPTION THEREADER WILL NOTICE BEING SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL. THE PRINCE LIBRARY WASBEQUEATHED TO A SOCIETY WHICH BECAME KNOWN AS THE NEW ENGLANDLIBRARY AND WHICH ITSELF HAD A SIMILAR LABEL PREPARED RECORDING THEGIFT. A PART OF THE COLLECTION IS NOW IN THE BOSTON PUBLIC LIBRARY.BUT THESE TWO EXAMPLES STAND BY THEMSELVES IT IS NOT UNTIL THE MIDDLEOF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THAT ANY NUMBER OF BOOKPLATES OF AMERICANEXECUTION ARE FOUND AFTER THAT THERE ARE A REALLY CONSIDERABLEQUANTITY. THEIR STYLE IS NOT PARTICULARLY DISTINCTIVE IT IS AT FIRSTEITHER JACOBEAN OR CHIPPENDALE OR A COMBINATION OF THE TWO STYLESLATER THE WREATH AND RIBBON AND LANDSCAPE AND PICTORIAL STYLES AREINTRODUCED AND TREATED MUCH AS IN ENGLAND. IN EXECUTION AMERICANBOOKPLATES ARE PERHAPS A TRIFLE COARSE. THE MORE PROMINENT OF THEIRENGRAVERS SEEM TO HAVE BEENHURD DAWKINS ANDERSON JOHNSONCALLENDAR DOOLITTLE THE MAVERICKS REVERE AND TURNER. REVERE IS THEBEST KNOWN HE WAS A PICTURE ENGRAVER OF SOME MERIT BUT FOR THE MOSTPART THE NAMES QUOTED ARE THOSE OF MEN OF LITTLE ARTISTIC REPUTATION.NATHANIEL HURD WAS PROBABLY THE EARLIEST OF THESE ENGRAVERS AND NOT THEWORST. HE WAS BORN AT BOSTON IN  THE SON OF AN AMERICAN WHO WAS AGOLDSMITH IN THAT TOWN. NATHANIEL WAS HIS FATHERS APPRENTICE HEDEVOTED HIMSELF TO WORKING ON COPPER AND SO NATURALLY WOULD TURN HISATTENTION TO BOOKPLATES. PROBABLY THE EARLIEST EXAMPLE SIGNED BY HIMAS N. H. AND DATED IN  WAS DESIGNED FOR THOMAS DERING. THIS ISTHE EARLIEST SIGNED AND DATED AMERICAN BOOKPLATE YET BROUGHT TO LIGHTHURD WAS BARELY TWENTY WHEN HE PRODUCED IT. AS A SEAL AND BOOKPLATEENGRAVER HE WORKED HARD AND WELL HE DIED IN . ONE OF HIS MOSTORIGINAL BOOKPLATES IS THAT OF HARVARD COLLEGE. A CURIOUSLY SHORT ANDWIDE SHIELD BEARING THE COLLEGE ARMS IS ENCIRCLED BY A BAND BEARINGTHE INSCRIPTION SIGILL. COLL. HARVARD. CANTAB. NOV. ANGL. .OUTSIDE THIS CIRCLE ARE TWO LEAF SPRAYS TIED AT THE BASE AND NEARLYMEETING AT THE TOP. BOTH IN CONCEPTION AND EXECUTION THIS IS A VERYPECULIAR BOOKPLATE. THE DERING PLATE ON THE OTHER HAND IS INTERESTINGAS SHOWING HOW EXACTLY THE STYLE OF THE MOTHERCOUNTRY AT THAT PERIODWAS COPIED IN AMERICA. HERE WE HAVE A PURE CHIPPENDALE BOOKPLATE OFAN UNPRONOUNCED TYPE.HENRY DAWKINS WHO BEGAN LIFE BY DESIGNING METAL BUTTONS HAD BEEN FOR ALONG TIME RESIDENT IN AMERICA WHEN IN  HE ENGRAVED THE BOOKPLATEOF JOHN BURNET OF NEW YORK. LIKE THE DERING PLATE BURNETS ISINTERESTING AND FOR THE SAME REASON IT IS CHIPPENDALE BUTDISTINCTLY LATER CHIPPENDALE WITH CUPIDS AND OTHER FIGURESINTRODUCED. DAWKINS WAS FOUND GUILTY OF COUNTERFEITING AND BEGGED TO BEHANGED RATHER THAN SUFFER THE IMPRISONMENT TO WHICH HE HAD BEENCONDEMNED. WHETHER OR NOT HIS REQUEST WAS GRANTED WE DO NOT KNOW.THAT THE HERALDRY ON SOME OF THESE AMERICAN BOOKPLATES SHOULD BESTARTLING IS ONLY TO BE EXPECTED. TAKE FOR INSTANCE THE VERYINTERESTING BOOKPLATE OF ROBERT DINWIDDIE DEPUTYGOVERNOR OF VIRGINIAFROM  WHICH WAS PROBABLY ENGRAVED A FEW YEARS BEFORE THE EARLIERDATE. HERE WE HAVE THE SHIELD DIVIDED FESSEFASHION AND IN THE UPPERAND LOWER DIVISIONS LANDSCAPESTHE FIRST INTRODUCING AN INDIAN ARCHERSHOOTING AT A STAG AND THE LOWER A FORT OR CASTLE WITH A SHIP AT SEASAILING TOWARDS IT. DINWIDDIE WAS A GOOD SERVANT TO THE ENGLISH CROWNBOTH IN BARBADOES AND VIRGINIA AND IS SAID LIKE MOST SUCCESSFUL PEOPLEOF HIS DAY TO BE DESCENDED FROM AN ANCIENT FAMILY THOUGH HIS IMMEDIATEANCESTORS WERE GLASGOW MERCHANTS. WE ARE HOWEVER NOT ASKED TO BELIEVEAND WE SHOULD NOT IF WE WERE THAT THE ARMS ARE MORE ANCIENT THANGOVERNOR DINWIDDIE HIMSELF OR THAT THEY ORIGINATED ELSEWHERE THAN INHIS MERCANTILE BRAIN THOUGH THEY MAY HAVE BEEN LEGALLY GRANTED BY THESCOTCH COLLEGE OF ARMS. THE PLATE LOOKS SCOTCHIT IS CHIPPENDALEAND I SUSPECT WAS ENGRAVED IN THE MOTHERCOUNTRY BY A SCOTCH ENGRAVER.WE MAY DATE IT ABOUT .THERE ARE OF COURSE SOME AMERICAN BOOKPLATES SPECIALLY INTERESTINGFROM THEIR POSSESSORS AND FOREMOST AMONGST THEM IS THAT OF GEORGEWASHINGTON. FOR ITS DESCRIPTION I CANNOT DO BETTER THAN QUOTE MR. ALLENTHE ARMS ARE DISPLAYED UPON A SHIELD OF THE USUAL SHELLLIKE FORM ANDTHE SPRAYS AND ROSEBRANCHES OF THIS STYLE CHIPPENDALE ARE USED IN THEORNAMENTATION OF THE SIDES OF THE ESCUTCHEON. THE MOTTO EXITUS ACTAPROBAT IS GIVEN UPON ITS RIBBON AT THE BASE OF THE SHIELD AND THENAME IS ENGRAVED IN SCRIPT ON THE BRACKET AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DESIGN.IN GENERAL APPEARANCE THE PLATE IS LIKE SCORES OF CHIPPENDALE PLATES OFTHE PERIOD. I AM SORRY TO TAKE SOMEWHAT FROM THE INTEREST WHICHATTACHES TO THIS BOOKPLATE BY SAYING THAT AS I LOOK MORE CLOSELY INTOIT AND STUDY THE DETAILS OF ITS ORNAMENTATION AND ITS EXECUTION I AMCONVINCED IT WAS ENGRAVED IN ENGLAND AND NOT IN AMERICA IT MUSTTHEREFORE BE OF AN EARLIER DATE THAN THAT ATTRIBUTED TO IT. I DO NOTTHINK IT IS SUBSEQUENT TO . OF COURSE THERE IS A FORGERY OF THISPLATE THOUGH IT WAS PREPARED NOT BECAUSE OF THE VALUE OF THEBOOKPLATE BUT TO SELL A NUMBER OF BOOKS WHICH WERE SAID TO HAVEBELONGED TO GEORGE WASHINGTON HIMSELF AND TO HAVE BEEN CAPTURED INVIRGINIA. THE FRAUD WAS HOWEVER DISCOVERED. NO DOUBT THESE FORGERIESARE NOW PALMED OFF AS THE GREAT MANS BOOKPLATE. MR. LICHTENSTEINSWORDS ABOUT THE REAL BOOKPLATE AND THE SHAM ARE THEREFORE IMPORTANTORIGINAL EXAMPLES ARE NOTICEABLE FOR THEIR SHARP BLACK IMPRESSIONS ONDAMPENED PLATE PAPER OF A BUFF COLOUR MELLOWED BY AGE. THOSE OF THEIMITATION ARE PRINTED FROM A PLATE WHICH HAS THE APPEARANCE OF HAVINGSEEN CONSIDERABLE WEAR BESIDES BEING PRINTED ON A DRY PAPER OF A THINQUALITY AND A BLUISH COLOUR BY ITS MODERN APPEARANCE IT IS EASILYRECOGNISED THE ENGRAVING OF THE NAME BEING POORLY DONE.I DO NOT KNOW IF A SERIES OF PRESIDENTS BOOKPLATES COULD BE SHOWN TOEXIST BUT WASHINGTONS SUCCESSOR JOHN ADAMS CERTAINLY USED ONEINTRODUCING INTO IT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF NATIONAL EMBLEMS. THE AMERICANEAGLE WITH OUTSPREAD WINGS OVERSHADOWS THE WHOLE DESIGN.OF AMERICAN WOMEN IN THE EARLY DAYS OF INDEPENDENCE ONLY ONE IS KNOWNTO HAVE USED A BOOKPLATE. THIS LADY WAS ELIZABETH GRME THE YOUNGESTCHILD OF DR. THOMAS GRME MEMBER OF THE PROVINCIAL COUNCIL AND INOTHER WAYS A DISTINGUISHED AND WEALTHY CITIZEN WHO OWNED GRME PARK ANESTATE LYING SOME TWENTY MILES FROM PHILADELPHIA. ELIZABETH WAS BORN IN. AT SEVENTEEN SHE WAS ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED BUT HER ENGAGEMENT WASSUDDENLYWHY WE LEARN NOTBROKEN OFF. TO DIVERT HER MIND SHE SET TOWORK TO TRANSLATE TLMAQUE. SHE CARRIED OUT THE TASK BUT IT WASNEVER PUBLISHED AND LIES TODAY AS SHE WROTE IT IN THE PHILADELPHIAMUSEUM. HER NEXT ENGAGEMENT WAS TO A MAN TEN YEARS HER JUNIORA MR.FERGUSON HIM SHE MARRIED BUT HER HUSBAND TAKING THE CROWNS PARTTHEY SEPARATED. BY THE TIME OF HER DEATH IN  SHE HAD GROWN NEEDYDESPITE THE FACT THAT SHE RECEIVED MONEY FROM HER LITERARY PRODUCTIONSWHICH WERE NUMEROUS. THOUGH EVIDENTLY A STAUNCH REPUBLICAN SHE WAS THEBEARER OF THE FAMOUS LETTER FROM THE REV. JACOB DUCH TO WASHINGTON INWHICH THE WRITER BEGGED HIS CORRESPONDENT TO RETURN TO HIS ALLEGIANCETO THE KING. THE BOOKPLATE WHICH IS IN EVERY WAY CURIOUS ANDINTERESTING IS ARMORIAL.AN INTERESTING POINT ABOUT AMERICAN BOOKPLATESWHICH ILLUSTRATES ADISTINCTIVE FEATURE IN SOCIAL LIFE THEREIS THE EXISTENCE OF A LARGENUMBER BELONGING TO FRIENDLY SOCIETIES MUTUAL IMPROVEMENT SOCIETIESAND INSTITUTIONS AKIN TO THEM FOR THE BOOKS FORMING THE LIBRARIES OFTHESE BODIES CONTAIN SOME OF THE MOST CURIOUS AND CHARACTERISTICAMERICAN BOOKPLATES. AMONGST THE NUMBER MAY BE MENTIONED THOSE OF THENEW YORK SOCIETY LIBRARY THE FARMINGTON LIBRARY THE HASTY PUDDINGSOCIETY AND THE PORCELLIAN CLUB IN HARVARD COLLEGE THE LINONIAN SOCIETYAND THE BROTHERS OF UNITY IN YALE AND THE SOCIAL FRIENDS IN DARTMOUTHCOLLEGE.NONE OF THESE ARE PARTICULARLY EARLY INDEED THE MAJORITY MUST BE DATEDAFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF INDEPENDENCE BUT THEY ARE WELL WORTHY OFSTUDY. ALLEGORY RUNS WILD IN THE BOOKPLATESTHERE ARE THREE MENTIONEDBY MR. DEXTER ALLENOF THE FIRSTNAMED SOCIETY AND MINERVA ISPROMINENT IN ALL. LET ME ENDEAVOUR TO DESCRIBE TWO BOTH THE WORK OFMAVERICK. IN ONE SHE HANDS A VOLUME OF THE SOCIETYS LIBRARY TO ANINDIAN WHOSE ATTITUDE IN RECEIVING IT SUGGESTS THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN ABOOK BEFORE IN WHICH CASE ITS CONTENTS CANNOT HAVE DONE HIM MUCH GOOD.IN THE OTHER SHE HAS JUST DESCENDED FROM OLYMPUS ENTERED THE LIBRARYAND SEIZED A VOLUME FROM THE BOOKSHELF WHICH SHE PRESENTS TO ANAPPARENTLY MORE APPRECIATIVE REDSKIN. I SAY APPRECIATIVE FOR IN RETURNHE HANDS THE GODDESS HIS TOMAHAWK. MINERVA WITH A TOMAHAWK CAN ANYTHINGBE MORE DELIGHTFULLY ABSURDONE MIGHT GO ON WITH MANY PAGES OF THESE DESCRIPTIONS BUT ENOUGH HASBEEN SAID TO SHOW THE BURLESQUE SPIRIT IN WHICH ALLEGORY IS TREATEDDOUBTLESS QUITE UNINTENTIONALLY ON AMERICAN SOCIETY BOOKPLATES. INTHAT FACT LIES MUCH OF THEIR INTEREST. MORE HAPPY IN CONCEPTION ANDEXECUTION IS THE HOMELIER DESIGN APPEARING ON THE BOOKPLATE OF THEVILLAGE LIBRARY IN FARMINGTON WHICH IF NOT A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OFENGRAVING IS AT LEAST FREE FROM GROTESQUENESS.IN THIS SAYS MR. ALLEN WE SEE THE INTERIOR OF A ROOM IN WHICH AYOUNG LADY PATRON OF THE LIBRARY IS STORING HER MIND WITH THOSE CHOICEAXIOMS WHICH IF PUT IN PRACTICE FAR EXCEED THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF MEREPERSONAL BEAUTY SO SAYS THE COUPLET BENEATH THE PICTURE    BEAUTIES IN VAIN THEIR PRETTY EYES MAY ROLL     CHARMS STRIKE THE SENSE BUT MERIT WINS THE SOUL.A WRITER IN THE EX LIBRIS JOURNAL POINTS OUT THAT AFTER THEREVOLUTION TILL ABOUT THE YEAR  THERE WERE SCARCELY ANY AMERICANARMORIAL BOOKPLATES. PERHAPS ONE OF THE EARLIEST IS THAT OF SAMUELELAM RHODE ISLAND WHICH APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN ENGRAVED ABOUT . ITIS PICTORIAL IN STYLE AND SHOWS A SHIELD BEARING ARMS RESTINGAGAINST A TREESTUMP WITH A LANDSCAPE BACKGROUND. THE MAJORITY OFAMERICAN BOOKPLATE POSSESSORS FROM  UNTIL THE FASHION OF USING ABOOKPLATE BECAME COMMON SOME LITTLE TIME BACK SEEM TO HAVE BEENMEMBERS OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION.DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS MANY AMERICAN BOOKPLATES HAVE BEEN AS WILDAND MEANINGLESS IN DESIGN AS THE MAJORITY OF THOSE RECENTLY PRODUCED INENGLAND ALTHOUGH AS MR. ALLENS ILLUSTRATIONS SHOW US A FEW TRULYARTISTIC AND APPROPRIATE EXAMPLES HAVE APPEARED. ONE MODERN BOOKPLATEFROM ACROSS THE ATLANTIC IS SURE TO ATTRACT ENGLISH EYES FOR THEOWNERS WORKS ARE READ AS EAGERLY AND APPRECIATED AS FULLY HERE AS INTHE STATESI MEAN THAT OF OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES. THIS TOO ISAPPROPRIATE FOR THE MAN CONSISTING SIMPLY OF A MOTTOSCROLL ON WHICHIS WRITTEN PER AMPLIORA AD ALTIORA AND A NAUTILUSTHE SHIP OFPEARL AS HE CALLS IT THE VENTUROUS BARK THAT FLINGS    ON THE SWEET SUMMER WINDS ITS PURPLED WINGS     IN GULFS ENCHANTED WHERE THE SIREN SINGS     AND CORAL REEFS LIE BARE     WHERE THE COLD SEA MAIDS RISE TO SUN THEIR STREAMING HAIR.FOOTNOTES AMERICAN BOOKPLATES. BY CHARLES DEXTER ALLEN. BELL AND SON. THE SAME REMARK APPLIES TO OTHER BOOKPLATES BEARING COLONIALADDRESSES SUCH AS THAT OF ISAAC ROYALL ESQ. OF ANTIGUA. IT MAY BE REMARKED AS CURIOUS THAT WILLIAM PENN DOES NOT ON HISBOOKPLATE IMPALE THE ARMS OF HANNAH CALLOWHILL TO WHOM HE WAS MARRIEDIN .CHAPTER IXINSCRIPTIONS ON BOOKPLATES IN CONDEMNATION OF BOOKSTEALING ORBOOKSPOILING AND IN PRAISE OF STUDYI PROPOSE NOW TO SPEAK ABOUT THE INSCRIPTIONS ON BOOKPLATES AND I WILLDIVIDE THEM AS FOLLOWS SENTIMENTS IN CONDEMNATION OF BOOKSTEALINGOR BOOKSPOILING  SENTIMENTS IN PRAISE OF BOOKS OR OF STUDY AND PERSONAL PARTICULARS OF THE OWNER OF THE BOOKPLATE WHICH LAST CLASSSHALL RECEIVE ATTENTION IN A SEPARATE CHAPTER. IN ALL THREE CASESILLUSTRATIONS MAY BE APPROPRIATELY DRAWN BOTH FROM ENGLISH AND FOREIGNEXAMPLES.LET ME BEGIN BY CALLING THE READERS ATTENTION TO THE FACT WHICH ICOMMENTED UPON IN MY FIRST CHAPTER THAT IN NEARLY ALL INSCRIPTIONS ONBOOKPLATES IT IS THE VOLUME IN WHICH THE BOOKPLATE IS PLACED AND NOTTHE BOOKPLATE ITSELF THAT IS SPOKESMAN. TAKE THE INSCRIPTION ON ONE OFTHE EARLIEST EXAMPLES LIBER BILIBALDI PIRCKHEIMER SIBI ET AMICIS.BILIBALD PIRCKHEIMERS BOOK FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FRIENDS HERE IS ANAMIABLE INTENTION BUT THE PLAN DID NOT WORK AND WE DO NOT FIND THESENTIMENT OFTEN REPEATED.

TO MENTION TWO THERE ARE CERTAIN DIFFERENCES SUCHAS THE SHAPE OF THE SHIELD IN WHICH THE ARMS ARE BORNE WHICH BY THERIGID LAWS OF HERALDRY OUGHT TO APPEAR ON THESE BOOKPLATES WHENBELONGING TO A MAID OR WIDOW MOREOVER LADIES BOOKPLATES THOUGHSOMETIMES MERE PRINTED LABELS ARE GENERALLY MORE FANCIFUL IN DESIGNTHAN THE MAJORITY OF THOSE OWNED BY THE STERNER SEX.THE WHOLE SUBJECT OF LADIES BOOKPLATES HAS BEEN SO EXHAUSTIVELYTREATED BY MISS NORNA LABOUCHERE THAT IT NEED NOT TAKE UP MUCH SPACE INTHE PRESENT CHAPTER. WHEN HOWEVER IN THIS WORK MISS LABOUCHERE ASKSWHERE ARE BOOKPLATES OF THE ENGLISH FEMININE BIBLIOPHILES OF THEFIFTEENTH SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURIESDAME JULIANA BERNERSMARGARET ROPER LADY JANE GREY MARY STUART AND THE LADIES OF LITTLEGIDDINGTHE ANSWER I AM AFRAID IS THEY HAD NONE. HAD THEY POSSESSEDTHEM THEY WOULD IN THIS BOOKPLATESPYING AGE HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED.ILLUSTRATION LADY BATHS BOOKPLATE.BUT BE IT SAID TO THE CREDIT OF THE LADIES SOME OF THE EARLIESTDATED ENGLISH BOOKPLATES BELONGED TO THEM. IT IS TRUE THESE ARE MERELYNAMETICKETS SUCH AS THAT OF ELIZABETH PINDAR  IN THE BAGFORDCOLLECTION KINDLY POINTED OUT TO ME BY MR. W. Y. FLETCHER BUT THE FACTOF THEIR EXISTENCE DESERVES NOTICE BECAUSE IT SHOWS THE READINESS OFTHE FAIR SEX TO LAY HOLD OF A NEW FASHION AND HAVING A BOOKPLATE INTHE EARLY YEARS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY WAS A NEW FASHION AT LEASTIN ENGLAND.THE FIRST ARMORIAL LADIES BOOKPLATE IS THAT OF THE COUNTESSDOWAGER OFBATH ALREADY VERY FULLY DESCRIBED. I WILL ONLY ADD THAT READERS WHOREFER BACK TO WHAT I HAVE SAID ABOUT HER MATRIMONIAL ARRANGEMENTSVIDE P.  WILL SEE THAT SHE IS HERALDICALLY ACCURATE IN NOTBEARING HER ARMS IN A LOZENGE. THE LAWS OF HERALDRY DO NOT ALLOW LADIESWHILE MARRIED TO PLACE THEIR ARMS IN LOZENGESHAPED SHIELDS AND THISFACT ENABLES SOME FEMININE BOOKPLATE OWNERS TO DEMONSTRATE THEPOSSESSION OF A VIRTUE WHICH WOMEN ARE OFTEN TAXED WITHLACKINGECONOMY. LADIES FREQUENTLY MADE THE SAME DESIGNS DO DUTY ASTHEIR OWN BOOKPLATES WHICH HAD SERVED FOR THEIR HUSBANDS. BUTACCORDING TO MISS LABOUCHERE THE HUSBAND SOMETIMES USED HIS WIFESBOOKPLATE FOR THE BOOKPLATESIDENTICAL SAVE FOR THEINSCRIPTIONSOF THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OF BEAUFORT LORD AND LADY ROOSAND SOME OTHERS SHOW ON EXAMINATION THAT THE WORDS INDICATIVE OFOWNERSHIP BY THE LADY HAVE BEEN ERASED AND OVERENGRAVED BY THOSEINDICATIVE OF POSSESSION BY HER LORD.THE LOZENGE REALLY LOOKS VERY WELL ON A BOOKPLATE AND LENDS ITSELFREADILY TO THE DECORATION USUALLY BESTOWED UPON IT. TAKE FOR INSTANCETHAT OF DAME ANNE MARGARETTA MASON DATED IN . HER MAIDEN NAME WASLONG AND THE SHIELD SHOWS US MASON IMPALING LONG. LADY MASONS IS AFAIR SAMPLE OF A LADYS BOOKPLATE OF THAT DATE. THE ARMS ARE CONTAINEDIN A LOZENGE SET IN A JACOBEAN FRAME WHICH IS LINED WITH SCALE WORKAND ADORNED WITH RIBBONS AND LEAFY SPRAYS. THERE IS NO MOTTOSCROLL BUTTHE NAME BRACKET COMES UP CLOSE TO THE BASE OF THE DESIGN SEE ALSO P..INDEED IT MAY BE SAID THAT THE JACOBEAN STYLE OF ORNAMENTATION IS THATBEST SUITED TO LADIES BOOKPLATES ESPECIALLY WHEN THE ARMS AREDEPICTED ON A LOZENGESHAPED SHIELD. THE BOOKPLATE OF THE HON. ANNENORTH BY SIMON GRIBELIN IS ANOTHER INSTANCE TO PROVE THIS. I DO NOTTHINK THAT CHIPPENDALE DECORATION SUITS THEM AT ALL AND IN THE USE OFORNAMENTS OF THAT STYLE ENGLISHWOMEN WERE AS IMMODERATE AS ENGLISHMEN.LADY LOMBES BOOKPLATE DESIGNED IN THE LATER DAYS OF CHIPPENDALISM ISQUITE APPALLING FROM ITS OVERORNAMENTATION. THE WREATH OF RIBBON ORFESTOON STYLE OF THE CLOSE OF THE LAST CENTURY IS MORE SUITABLE FORLADIES BOOKPLATES AND SOME VERY CHARMING EXAMPLES ARE KNOWN EQUALLYSUITABLE IT SEEMS TO ME WOULD HAVE BEEN THE PICTURE OR LANDSCAPESTYLETHE STYLE IN WHICH AT THE CLOSE OF THE LAST CENTURY BEWICK ANDSOME FEW OTHER ENGLISH ARTISTS WERE WORKING WITH CONSPICUOUS SUCCESSAND IT SEEMS STRANGE THAT THE LADIES OF GREAT BRITAIN DID NOT ADOPT ITMORE EXTENSIVELY.WHEN WE COME TO MODERN TIMES WE FIND LADIES HAVE RUN AS WILD AS THEIRLORDS OVER BOOKPLATES THERE IS THE SAME PECULIARITY THE SAMEMYSTICISM THE SAME INAPPROPRIATENESS FOR BOOKPLATES IN THE DESIGNS OFMANY BOOKPLATES OF FIN DE SICLE ENGLISH LADIES. THE FEW REALLYARTISTIC AND APPROPRIATE BOOKPLATES STAND OUT IN MARKED CONTRAST INMISS LABOUCHERES EXCELLENT LITTLE BOOK AND AMONGST THEM MAY BE NOTEDLADY MAYOS DESIGNED IN  BY MR. ANNING BELL WHICH SHOWS US AMUSICIAN AND A SONGSTRESS WITHIN A FRAME COMPOSED OF SPRING FLOWERS ANDTHE NATIONAL EMBLEM OF IRELAND.BUT LET US GO BACK A LITTLE IN DATE AND LOOK AT A LADIES BOOKPLATEDESIGNED IN THE ALLEGORIC STYLE WHAT MORE STRIKING EXAMPLE COULD BEFOUND THAN THAT FURNISHED BY GEORGE VERTUES CHARMING PIECE OF WORKENGRAVED FOR LADY OXFORDILLUSTRATIONIT REPRESENTS THE INTERIOR OF THE LIBRARY EITHER AT BRAMPTON OR WELBECKPROBABLY THE LATTER WHICH WAS LADY OXFORDS OWN INHERITANCE. THROUGH ADOORWAY FLANKED BY CORINTHIAN COLUMNS THE CURTAIN IN FRONT OF WHICH ISDRAWN BACK WE OBTAIN A VIEW OF A COUNTRY HOUSE STANDING BACK IN AWELLKEPT PARK A RIVER CROSSED BY A THREEARCHED BRIDGE MEANDERSTHROUGH THIS. BUT IT IS THE OCCUPANTS OF THE ROOM THAT CALL FOR MOSTATTENTION. THE PROMINENT FIGURE IS THAT OF MINERVA WHO HAS LAID ASIDEHER ARMS AND STANDS SANDALLED AND HELMETED. SHE IS BUSILY ENGAGED ININSTRUCTING SIX CUPIDS WHO APPEAR TO BE INDUSTRIOUSLY FOLLOWING HERINJUNCTIONS. ONE OF THESE IS PAINTING IN OILS WITH AN EASEL BEFOREHIM AND A PALETTE ON HIS THUMB THE GODDESS WITH HER LEFT HAND POINTSOUT SOME DEFECT IN HIS WORK AND APPARENTLY EXPLAINS HOW IT MAY BEREMEDIED. ANOTHER CUPID PLAYS THE HARP TWO MORE SIT ON THE FRAME OF THEDESIGN WEAVING FLOWING FESTOONS ANOTHER ALSO ON THE FRAME NEAR ACELESTIAL GLOBE COPIES THE PICTURE OF A FLUTEPLAYING SATYR WHICH ASIXTH CUPID HOLDS IN POSITION.ON THE FRAME WHICH SURROUNDS THE PICTURE SIT TWO FIGURESONE OF WHICHIS MERCURY WITH CADUCEUS AND WINGED HATWHO ACT AS SUPPORTERS TO AMEDALLION BEARING LADY OXFORDS MONOGRAM ABOVE IS AN URN AND FROM THESIDES FALL BUNCHES OF GRAPES. BELOW THE DESIGN IS ENGRAVED HENRIETTACAVENDISH HOLLES OXFORD AND MORTIMER. GIVEN ME BYAND THEN THEDONORS NAME AND LAST TWO FIGURES OF THE DATE FILLED IN BY LADY OXFORDHERSELF.LADY OXFORD WAS THE SOLE HEIRESS OF JOHN HOLLES LAST DUKE OF NEWCASTLEOF THE HOLLES FAMILY AND WAS THE WIFE OF EDWARD SECOND EARL OF OXFORDSON OF QUEEN ANNES MINISTER AND THE CONTINUATOR AND COMPLETOR OF THEHARLEIAN COLLECTIONS. VERTUES LOVE OF STUDYING ALL KINDS OF ANTIQUITIESBROUGHT HIM AT AN EARLY DATE INTO CONTACT WITH LORD OXFORD WHO PROVEDONE OF HIS WARMEST PATRONS. THE ARTIST HIMSELF SPEAKS OF THE EARLSGENEROUS AND UNPARALLELED ENCOURAGEMENT OF MY UNDERTAKINGS. HARLEYWOULD TAKE HIS FRIEND WITH HIM ON HIS VARIOUS HUNTING TOURS INENGLAND GETTING HIM TO SKETCH THE NUMEROUS OBJECTS OF INTEREST THATTHEY CAME ACROSS. NO WONDER THAT THE EARLS DEATH IN  WAS A HEAVYLOSS IN EVERY WAY TO GEORGE VERTUE.IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT THERE IS NO TRACE OF HERALDRY IN THIS REMARKABLEBOOKPLATE. BOOKPLATES FREE FROM ANYTHING ARMORIAL WERE NOT THE RULE INENGLAND IN  AND VERTUE WAS CERTAINLY PROFICIENT IN HERALDICENGRAVING OR OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN SO SINCE HIS EARLIEST TASK IN LIFE WASENGRAVING COATS OF ARMS ON PLATE AND HIS SECOND ENGAGEMENT WAS WITHMICHAEL VANDERGUCHT WHO WE KNOW EXECUTED A GOOD DEAL OF ARMORIALWORK. IT IS PROBABLE THEREFORE THAT THE IDEA OF THE BOOKPLATE WASLADY OXFORDS OWN.FROM THIS DELIGHTFUL SPECIMEN OF A LADYS BOOKPLATE IN WHICH HERALDRYIS ENTIRELY ABSENT WE MAY APPROPRIATELY TURN OUR ATTENTION TO TWOEXAMPLES WHICH COMBINE HERALDRY WITH A FANCIFUL DESIGNTHE BOOKPLATESOF LADY POMFRET AND THE HONOURABLE MRS. DAMER. THE FIRST OF THESE ISTHAT WHICH S. W. PROBABLY SAMUEL WALE THE ROYAL ACADEMICIANENGRAVED FOR THE RT HONBLE HENRIETTA LOUISA JEFFREYS COUNTESS OFPOMFRET LADY OF THE BEDCHAMBER TO QUEEN CAROLINE AND IS A VERYUNUSUAL PIECE OF WORK BOTH IN SHAPE DESIGN AND HERALDRY. THERE IS ACLEAR INDICATION OF CHIPPENDALEISM ABOUT THE SHIELD AND SPRAYS OFFLOWERS AND LEAVES WHICH IS CERTAINLY CURIOUS IN VIEW OF WHAT WE MUSTCONSIDER THE APPROXIMATE DATE OF THE BOOKPLATE BUT THE ARMS ARE IN AJACOBEAN FRAME WHICH STANDS IN A GARDEN. ON ONE SIDE WE HAVE A CUPIDBEARING ALOFT THE LADYS FAMILY CREST AND ON THE OTHER THE HUSBANDSCREST AND HELMET SITUATED JUST WITHIN THE OPENING OF A TENT. LADYPOMFRET WAS THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF JAMES II.S INFAMOUS LORD CHANCELLOR.SHE MARRIED LORD POMFRET IN  AND WAS LADY OF THE BEDCHAMBER TOQUEEN CAROLINE FROM  TO  SO THAT WE ARE ENABLED TO FIX THE DATEOF THIS PLATE WITHIN SEVENTEEN YEARS INDEED PROBABLY WITHIN FOURYEARS FOR SHE HAD A LESS AMBITIOUS AND NO DOUBT EARLIER BOOKPLATEENGRAVED FOR HER WHICH BEARS THE DATE .AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED THE BOOKPLATE OF SELINA COUNTESS OFHUNTINGDON FORMS A STRIKING CONTRAST TO THAT LAST DESCRIBED. HERE WEHAVE A PLAIN REPRESENTATION OF A COAT OF ARMS IN A LOZENGE ANDSUPPORTED IN THE ORTHODOX MANNER. NO CUPIDS OR OTHER VANITIES INTRUDETHEMSELVES INTO THIS SOMBRE AND COARSELY EXECUTED WORK WHICH MAY BEDATED AFTER THE OWNER BECAME A WIDOW IN  AND THEREFORE AFTER HERCALLWHICH IS I BELIEVE THE CORRECT EXPRESSION FOR A SUDDENCONVERSION TO THE FORM OF RELIGION SHE EMBRACED.PROBABLY OF ABOUT THE SAME DATE AS LADY HUNTINGDONS BOOKPLATE IS THATOF ANOTHER FAMOUS WOMAN OF HER DAY LADY BETTY GERMAIN ABOUT WHOM SWIFTHAS PLENTY TO SAY IN HIS JOURNAL TO STELLA. ON THIS BOOKPLATE ASOMEWHAT FUNEREAL EFFECT IS PRODUCED BY THE DARK BACKGROUND AGAINSTWHICH IS THE LOZENGE CONTAINING THE ARMS BERKELEY IMPALING GERMAIN BUTTHE ORNAMENTATION OF THE LOZENGE OF THE NAMESCROLL AND OF THE FRAMEENCLOSING THE DESIGN IS LIGHT AND ELEGANT. POOR LADY BETTY SHE HAD AGOOD DEAL TO LIVE DOWN HER GIRLHOOD HAD NOT BEEN SO MORAL AS IT MIGHTHAVE BEEN AND THE DUCHESS OF MARLBOROUGH DID HER BEST TO MAKE HERFRIENDS MISFORTUNES AS PUBLIC AS POSSIBLE. BUT FOR ALL THAT ELIZABETHBERKELEY MADE A GOOD MATCH IN POINT OF MONEY MARRYINGAS HIS SECONDWIFESIR JOHN GERMAIN A SOLDIER OF FORTUNE AND REPUTE. HE LEFT HER AWIDOW IN  WITH DRAYTON AS HER HOME AND A VAST FORTUNE. HERWIDOWHOOD LASTED VERY NEARLY FIFTY YEARS DURING WHICH SHE GAVE AWAYLARGE SUMS IN CHARITY AS WELL AS SPENDING THEM ON AMASSING CURIOSTHESE IN  WALPOLE WENT TO LOOK AT AND ADMIRED.BUT WE HAVE BEEN DIGRESSING AND HAVE NOT YET SPOKEN ABOUT THE SECOND OFTHE TWO BOOKPLATES JUST NOW MENTIONED THAT OF THE HON. MRS. DAMERWHICH IN DESIGN AND EXECUTION CERTAINLY SURPASSES ANY LADIESBOOKPLATE YET NOTICED IT IS REALLY A BEAUTIFUL PICTURE. FIRST LET MESPEAK OF MRS. DAMER AND HER SURROUNDINGS HER BOOKPLATE BECOMES THEMORE INTERESTING AS WE CALL THESE TO MIND. THE DAUGHTER OF FIELDMARSHALHENRY SEYMOUR CONWAY SHE MADE FOR HERSELF AT AN EARLY AGE A NAMEBOTH IN ENGLAND AND ITALY AS AN ACCOMPLISHED SCULPTRESS.

NEXT AFTER HIM COMES THEWELLKNOWN ENGRAVER OF PORTRAITS WILLIAM FAITHORNE B.  D. WHOSE PORTRAIT BOOKPLATE OF BISHOP HACKET IS FIGURED OPPOSITE. DAVIDLOGGAN THE ENGRAVER OF THE ISHAM BOOKPLATES IN  IS THE ARTISTNEXT ON OUR ROLL. HOW MANY BOOKPLATES HE DESIGNED AND ENGRAVED I DO NOTKNOW BUT THERE ARE TWO OR THREE EARLY ENGLISH EXAMPLES WHICH IN THEIRARRANGEMENT AND TOUCH RESEMBLE SOMEWHAT CLOSELY HIS WORK FOR ISHAM.ILLUSTRATIONABOUT THIS SAME DATE MICHAEL BURGHERS WAS ENGRAVING BOOKPLATES INENGLAND HE APPEARS TO HAVE LEFT HOLLAND IN  AND TO HAVE SETTLED INOXFORD. THE EARLIEST BOOKPLATE OF HIS THAT I HAVE SEEN IS THAT OFTHOMAS GORE ALREADY DESCRIBED PERHAPS HE FOUND THE ALLEGORY WITH WHICHHE EMBELLISHED IT WAS NOT POPULAR WITH ENGLISHMEN AND HIS OTHERBOOKPLATESWE KNOW OF TWO OR THREEARE IN THE SIMPLE ARMORIAL STYLEUSUAL IN ENGLISH BOOKPLATES OF THE PERIOD. LORD DE TABLEY SUGGESTS THATCHRISTOPHER SARTORIUS WHO WORKED AT NUREMBERG BETWEEN  AND MAY BE CONNECTED WITH THE JAMES SARTOR WHO SIGNED A FINE ENGLISHJACOBEAN BOOKPLATE AT THE OPENING OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY OF THISJAMES WE KNOW NOTHING EXCEPT THIS PIECE OF WORK WHICH IS CERTAINLYGOOD. AFTER SARTOR COMES JOHN PINE WHOSE POMPOUS BOOKPLATE ENGRAVEDABOUT THE YEAR  TO COMMEMORATE GEORGE I.S GIFT OF BOOKS TO THEUNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AND FIGURED P. . HE WASBORN IN  AND DIED IN . HIS ENGRAVINGS OF THE TAPESTRY IN THEHOUSE OF COMMONS BECAME SO POPULAR THAT HE WAS THE SUBJECT OF A SPECIALACT OF PARLIAMENT SECURING TO HIM THE EMOLUMENTS ARISING FROM THE SALEOF THE WORK. PINE AS WE HAVE SEEN ENGRAVED OTHER BOOKPLATES LATER ONIN THE CENTURY.MICHAEL VANDERGUCHT THE FAMOUS ANTWERP ENGRAVER WAS ALSO WORKING INENGLAND BEFORE THE CLOSE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY BUT HIS FIRSTBOOKPLATE IS DATED IN . THIS WAS ENGRAVED FOR SIR WILLIAM FLEMINGOF RYDAL AND IS IN MANY RESPECTS A STRIKING PIECE OF WORK. THE STYLE ISQUITE ENGLISH OF THE PERIOD HEAVY MANTLING DESCENDS TO THE BASE OF THESHIELD BUT THE INSCRIPTIONTHE PATERNAL ARMS OF SIR WILLIAM FLEMINGOF RYDAL IN THE COUNTY OF WESTMORELAND BARONET WITH A DESCRIPTION OFTHE HERALDRYSAVOURS MUCH OF BEING THE WORK OF A FOREIGNER. IT SHOULDBE MENTIONED OF THIS ARTIST THAT HE WAS PUPIL OF ONE OF THE MANY BOUTATSWHO WERE ACTIVE AS ENGRAVERS OF FOREIGN BOOKPLATES. HE VANDERGUCHTDIED IN BLOOMSBURY IN .AFTER HIM WE MAY APPROPRIATELY MENTION HIS PRINCIPAL PUPILGEORGEVERTUE. HIS MOST CONSPICUOUS BOOKPLATE IS CERTAINLY THAT OF LADYOXFORD WHICH IS ALREADY FAMILIAR TO THE READER.SIMON GRIBELIN IS WELL KNOWN AS A BOOKILLUSTRATOR AND FINDS FREQUENTMENTION BY WALPOLE. HE WAS BORN AT BLOIS IN  CAME TO ENGLAND WHENNINETEEN AND WORKED HERE TILL HIS DEATH IN . PERHAPS THE EARLIESTBOOKPLATE HE ENGRAVED IS THAT OF SIR PHILIP SYDENHAM WHICH SHOWS USTHE SHIELD AND CREST ENCIRCLED WITH SNAKES AND OTHER ORNAMENTSABOOKPLATE DECIDEDLY FOREIGN IN APPEARANCE THOUGH GRIBELIN MUST HAVEBEEN NEARLY TWENTY YEARS IN ENGLAND WHEN IT WAS ENGRAVED. HE DID TWOOTHER BOOKPLATES FOR SIR PHILIP. HE ALSO ENGRAVED SOME OF THE PAROCHIALLIBRARY PLATES DESCRIBED LATER ON PP.  AND SOME OTHERS.ILLUSTRATIONTHOUGH J. SKINNER SEE PP.  AN ENGRAVER WHO WORKED AT BATHDOES NOT FIND MENTION IN ANY DICTIONARY OF ENGRAVERS YET HE DESERVESNOTICE FROM THE STUDENT OF BOOKPLATES FOR THE GREAT QUANTITY OF HISWORK IN THAT FIELDNEARLY ALL DATED AND SOME REALLY VERY EXCELLENT. OFSKINNER LORD DE TABLEY WRITESI WOULD GLADLY LEARN SOME BIOGRAPHICALDETAILS BUT HE FAILED TO FIND ANY AND I HAVE BEEN EQUALLYUNFORTUNATE. AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM THERE IS NO BATH NEWSPAPER ORDIRECTORY SUFFICIENTLY EARLY TO CONTAIN EITHER AN ADVERTISEMENT BYSKINNER OR A MENTION OF HIS PLACE OF RESIDENCE IN THE BATH DIRECTORYOF  THE NAME IS REPRESENTED BY TWO GROCERS A PUBLICAN A GARDENERAND ONE PRIVATE RESIDENTA MISS SKINNER WHO LIVED AT  ST. JAMESSPARADE. SIR WOLLASTON FRANKS TELLS ME THAT AMONGST THE ENGRAVERS WHOVOUCHED FOR THE PERFECTION OF SYMPSONS NEW BOOK OF CYPHERTHE MOSTPERFECT AND NEATEST DRAWN OF ANY PERFORMANCE OF THE KIND HITHERTOEXTANTWAS ONE JACOB SKINNER AND IT IS VERY LIKELY THIS WAS OURFRIEND THE ENGRAVER OF BOOKPLATES WHO LABOURED AT BATH FROM  TO. HE WORKED IN THREE SUCCESSIVE STYLES OF ENGLISH BOOKPLATEENGRAVINGTHE ARMORIAL THE JACOBEAN AND THE CHIPPENDALE A FACT WHICHRENDERS HIS PLATES OF SPECIAL INTEREST TO COLLECTORS SINCE IT ENABLESTHEM TO SEE HOW THE SAME HAND TREATS THE SUCCEEDING STYLES WHEN FULLYDEVELOPED AND DURING THEIR GRADUAL CHANGE FROM ONE STYLE INTO THEOTHER. HIS EARLIEST DATED BOOKPLATE THAT WE KNOW IS THAT FOR THELIBRARY OF SIR CHRISTOPHER MUSGRAVE FIGURED OPPOSITE AND THE NEXTFIVE YEARS LATER THAT OF JOHN CONYERS OF WALTHAMSTOW IN ESSEX ESQ.HERE THE ORNAMENTATION IS QUITE JACOBEAN THE SHIELD IS OVAL WITHWINGLIKE EXCRESCENCES AT THE TOP AND ON EITHER SIDETHAT AT THE TOPFORMING A BACKGROUND TO THE HELMET WHICH SUPPORTS THE CREST. NEXT YEAR SKINNER PRODUCED THE BOOKPLATE OF FRANCIS CARINGTON ESQ. OFWOTTON WARWICKSHIREIN APPEARANCE EVEN EARLIER THAN THAT OF MUSGRAVE.SOME OF THIS EARLY APPEARANCE IS PERHAPS DUE TO AN ABSENCE OF INDICATIONOF THE TINCTURES ON THE SHIELDA HABIT WHICH AS WE SHALL PRESENTLYSEE SKINNER FOLLOWED IN ONE OR TWO OTHER INSTANCES. A SLIGHT MANTLINGFALLS FROM AN ESQUIRES HELMET AND DESCENDS A LITTLE WAY DOWN THE SHIELDTILL IT JOINS THE JACOBEAN SCROLLWORK AND THE OWNERS NAME ANDDESCRIPTION ARE UPON A FRINGED CLOTH. BUT THE FEATURE TO NOTE IN THISBOOKPLATE IS THE MONOGRAMMATIC FORM OF THE ENGRAVERS SIGNATUREILLUSTRATION JS SYMBOL. IT IS THE FIRST TIME HE USES IT AND IN HISSUBSEQUENT DATED WORK HE APPEARS ALWAYS TO HAVE ADOPTED SOME SIMILARFORM THIS BEING THE MOST FREQUENTILLUSTRATION JS SYMBOLKINR.ILLUSTRATIONI HAVE SPOKEN OF J. SKINNER AS A BATH ENGRAVER BUT THE READER WILLOBSERVE THAT NONE OF THE BOOKOWNERS WHOSE BOOKPLATES BY HIM I HAVE ASYET NAMED ARE SPECIALLY CONNECTED WITH BATH AND ON NONE HAS THEENGRAVER MENTIONED IT AS HIS PLACE OF RESIDENCE BUT INSOMUCH ASTHENIN THE PALMY DAYS OF THE REIGN OF KING NASHALL ROADS LED TOBATH IT IS PROBABLE THAT AT THE FASHIONABLE SEASON THE CUMBERLANDBARONET AS WELL AS THE ESSEX AND WARWICKSHIRE SQUIRES FOUND HIS WAYTHITHER AND FOLLOWED THE FASHION BY HAVING A BOOKPLATE ENGRAVED JUSTAS HE WOULD FOLLOW IT DURING HIS SOJOURN IN THE ANCIENT CITY BYSQUANDERING HIS TIME AND INJURING HIS DIGESTION WITH LATE HOURS AND ASURFEIT OF GENERALLY UNWHOLESOME GAIETY. THE NEXT DATED BOOKPLATE BYSKINNER BEARS THIS OUT ON THIS ENGRAVED IN  HE GIVES BATH AS HISPLACE OF ABODE BUT THIS BOOKPLATE IS THAT OF FRANCIS MASSY OF RIXTONLANCASHIRE IT IS SIMILAR IN DESIGN TO THE CARINGTON JUST MENTIONED ANDFIGURED.BUT EARLIER IN STYLE THAN ANY OF SKINNERS WORK YET MENTIONED IS THEBOOKPLATE OF WILLIAM HILLARY M.D. DATED IN  HERE THE MANTLINGDESCENDS NEARLY TO THE BASE OF THE SHIELD QUITE IN THE ARMORIALSTYLE. THIS SEEMS TO BE HIS LATEST WORK IN EARLY FASHION. IN  HE HADDESIGNED A BOOKPLATE FOR JOHN WILLIAM FUHR IN WHICH THERE ARE CLEARINDICATIONS OF CHIPPENDALE ORNAMENTATION. THIS IS INDEED A TRANSITIONALBOOKPLATE IT HAS A JACOBEAN SHIELD WHICH THE ARTIST HAS ADORNED WITHCHIPPENDALE ORNAMENT THE TINCTURES ARE ONLY PARTIALLY EXPRESSED AND THESHIELD REMAINS SYMMETRICAL THOUGH THE FLORAL SPRAYS AND SHELLWORK GIVEIT AT FIRST SIGHT THE APPEARANCE OF NOT BEING SO. IDENTICAL ALMOSTWITH THIS BOOKPLATE IS THAT DONE BY SKINNER FOR HENRY PENNANT ANDDATED IN  AND LIKE IT BUT WEAKER IS THAT OF THOS. HAVILANDBATH DATED IN THE SAME YEAR.ILLUSTRATIONSKINNERS NEXT BOOKPLATES ARE THOSE OF CHARLES DELAFAYE ESQ. OFWICHBURY WILTS  JOHNSON ROBINSON  JOHN HUGHES OFBRECON ESQRE. AND BENJA ADAMSON  HEN. TOYE BRIDGEMANESQ. OF PRINCKNASH GLOUCESTERSHIRE  HENRY WALTERS ESQ. ANDJOHN WODROOFE  AND THOS. FITZHERBERT ESQ. . ALLTHESE LASTNAMED BOOKPLATES ARE MUCH ON A LEVEL AS REGARDS ARTISTICMERIT AND THAT LEVEL IS NOT A HIGH ONE BENJAMIN ADAMSONS BOOKPLATEFIGURED ON P.  IS A FAIR EXAMPLE OF IT THOUGH IT IS NOT SO GOOD ASTHE BRIDGEMAN BOOKPLATE OF THE SAME YEAR. IN  HOWEVER WE FIND AMORE NOTEWORTHY SPECIMEN OF SKINNERS WORK IN THE BOOKPLATE OF FRANCISFLEMING. THERE IS A SCOTCH LOOK ABOUT THIS WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THEOWNER AND NOT THE ENGRAVER WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS DESIGN THE SHIELDIS ODDLY SHAPED AND IS ON A MEDALLION WHILST MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS OFVARIOUS KINDS ARE FIGURED BENEATH SIR WOLLASTON FRANKS POINTS OUT TO METHAT THE FLEMING COAT OF ARMS HERE REPRESENTED IS BORNE ONLY BY THEFAMILY OF THE EARLS OF WIGTOWN. THE SAME YEAR  SKINNER DID ANORDINARY CHIPPENDALE BOOKPLATE FOR DR. ROBERT GUSTHART WHOSE NAMEAPPEARS IN THE BATH GUIDE AS A DOCTOR IN PRACTICE THERE IN .IN  SKINNER ENGRAVED A PLEASING CHIPPENDALE BOOKPLATE FOR WILLIAMOLIVER A SON OF HIS MORE FAMOUS NAMESAKE WHOSE BOOKPLATE ALSO BYSKINNER HAS BEEN ALREADY DESCRIBED IN THESE PAGES P. . YOUNGOLIVERS PLATE SHOWS A REMARKABLE FINENESS OF TOUCH AND IS ALTOGETHERIN VERY GOOD TASTENOT OVERORNAMENTED. TWO YEARS LATER WE HAVE THELATEST KNOWN EXAMPLE OF SKINNERS WORK THE BOOKPLATE OF THE REVDI. DOBSON A.M.

CLUMSILY DRAWN AND CLUMSILYPOSED FEMALE FIGURES PARTLY DRAPED STAND UPON BRACKETLIKEEXCRESCENCES THAT SPRING FROM THE SHIELD WHILST CUPIDS RECLINE BELOW ITAND HOLD IT ALOFT.WHAT HAPPENED TO SKINNER AFTER  I HAVE FAILED TO DISCOVER. HE ISCERTAINLY AN INTERESTING PERSON FROM A BOOKPLATE COLLECTORS POINT OFVIEW AND IT IS TO BE HOPED SOMETHING MORE ABOUT HIM MAY SOME DAY BEBROUGHT TO LIGHT. IN CONSIDERING HIS IDENTITY IT IS WORTH REMEMBERINGTHAT A LITTLE AFTER HIS DISAPPEARANCE VIZ. IN  ANOTHER WEST OFENGLAND ENGRAVER NAMED SKINNERMATTHEW SKINNER OF EXETER IS FOUNDWORKING ON BOOKPLATES. HE SIGNS THREE EXAMPLES ALL DESIGNED IN THECHIPPENDALE STYLEJEAN ELI JAQURI DE MOUDON EN SUISSE N EN SR EDMD THOMAS BART. AND PEREGRINE FRAS THORNE. THE TWOFIRST ARE ORDINARY CHIPPENDALE EXAMPLES BUT IN THE THIRD MANYIMPLEMENTS OF THE SOLDIERS ART ARE INTRODUCED.ANOTHER VERY PROLIFIC ENGRAVER OF BOOKPLATESUNKNOWN EXCEPT IN THATCAPACITYWAS ROBERT MOUNTAINE. HIS BOOKPLATES ARE FREQUENTLY DATEDBUT THE DATES ARE PLACED IN THE MOST OBSCURE POSITIONS AND IN THESMALLEST OF FIGURES SO IT NEEDS A CAREFUL STUDY OF THE ENGRAVINGS TODISCOVER THEM. HE LABOURED WHOLLY IN THE CHIPPENDALE STYLE HIS TOUCHIS PECULIAR AND HIS TREATMENT GRACEFUL. ROUGHLY SPEAKING HE WORKEDFROM  TO .

WHO SIGNS CERTAIN EXAMPLES ONCE WRONGLY ASCRIBED TO HOGARTHWAS A CERTAIN WILLIAM HIBBART WHO LIKE SKINNER WAS A BATH ARTIST ANDETCHED PORTRAITS AFTER THE MANNER OF WORLIDGE. LORD DE TABLEY MENTIONSTHAT WORLIDGE HIMSELF EXECUTED A BOOKPLATETHAT OF THE HONOURABLEHENRIETTA KNIGHTWHICH HE SIGNS IN FULL. WORLIDGE WAS CERTAINLY ADISTINGUISHED ENGRAVER HIS ETCHINGS AFTER REMBRANDT ARE EXCELLENT ANDHIGHLY PRIZED. HE DIED IN .THE WORK OF SIR ROBERT STRANGE AS A BOOKPLATE ENGRAVER HAS BEEN ALREADYREFERRED TO. BOTH LUMISDENS AND DR. DRUMMONDS BOOKPLATES WEREPROBABLY EXECUTED AFTER STRANGES DEPARTURE FROM ENGLAND AND THEREFOREAFTER . HIS CONTINENTAL VISIT WAS RENDERED NECESSARY OR AT LEASTEXPEDIENT BY THE MANNER IN WHICH HE HAD IDENTIFIED HIMSELF WITH THESTUART CAUSE DURING THE THEN RECENT TROUBLES. HE HAD JOINED THE JACOBITELIFEGUARDS AND EMPLOYED HIS ARTISTIC ABILITY IN DESIGNING PAYNOTESFOR THE JACOBITE SOLDIERS. AFTER STUDYING SOME TIME IN PARIS UNDER LEBAS HE RETURNED TO ENGLAND WHERE HE REMAINED TILL . HE THEN WENTBACK TO THE CONTINENT WHERE HIS ABILITY WAS FREELY APPRECIATED ANDWHERE HE WAS LOADED WITH DECORATIONS AT ROME AND FLORENCE. ENGLAND ATLENGTH RECOGNISED HIS MERIT AND IN  THE KING CONFERRED UPON HIM AKNIGHTHOOD WHICH HE LIVED FOR FIVE YEARS TO ENJOY. HIS DEVOTION TO THEHOUSE OF STUART NEVER ALTERED THE INSCRIPTION BENEATH ONE OF HIS MOSTCELEBRATED PORTRAITS READS CHARLES JAMES EDWARD STUART CALLED THEYOUNG PRETENDER.AFTER THE DAYS OF STRANGE AN INNUMERABLE NUMBER OF ARTISTS SIGN THEIRNAMES TO ENGLISH BOOKPLATES YET WITH THREE EXCEPTIONS THE NAMES OFNONE ARE KNOWN TO FAME TILL WE COME TO THOSE OF A COMPARATIVELY RECENTDATE. THE EXCEPTIONS ARE FRANCIS BARTOLOZZI JOHN KEYS SHERWIN ANDTHOMAS BEWICK. BARTOLOZZI THE MAN OF WHOM SIR ROBERT STRANGE DISPLAYEDSUCH ILLCONCEALED JEALOUSY BEGAN TO WORK IN ENGLAND ABOUT FOUR YEARSAFTER THE ACCESSION OF GEORGE III. THOUGH IT WAS SOME YEARS BEFORE HISWORTH WAS APPRECIATED BY THE PEOPLE WITH WHOM HE CAME TO RESIDE. NONE OFHIS BOOKPLATES BELONG TO A DATE PRIOR TO  OR . HE REMOVED TOLISBON IN  TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY AND WHILE THEREIT WILL BE REMEMBERED ENGRAVED AN ENGLISHMANS BOOKPLATE IN  SEEP. . HIS DEATH TOOK PLACE AT LISBON IN . SHERWIN WAS BORN INPOVERTY AND OWING LARGELY TO HIS OWN FOLLY DIED IN IT AFTER HAVINGAT ONE TIME AMASSED A CONSIDERABLE SUM OF MONEY. HE WAS A PUPIL OFBARTOLOZZI GAINED THE ROYAL ACADEMY GOLD MEDAL IN  AND WASAPPOINTED ENGRAVER TO THE KING IN OR ABOUT . HIS BOOKPLATE WORK ISREFERRED TO AT P. .THOMAS BEWICK WHO AS WE HAVE SEEN PP.  WAS THE MOST PROLIFICOF ANY ENGLISH ENGRAVER OF BOOKPLATES WAS BORN AT CHERRY BURN INNORTHUMBERLAND IN  AND DIED IN . THE INCIDENTS IN HIS HISTORYARE TOO WELL KNOWN TO NEED REPETITION HERE AND HIS WORK UPONBOOKPLATES HAS BEEN ALREADY MENTIONED. IT MAY BE HOWEVER NOTICED THATHIS EARLIEST BOOKPLATE IS DATED IN  THE YEAR IN WHICH HE PUBLISHEDTHE FIRST VOLUME OF HIS BRITISH BIRDS.FOOTNOTE SEE ARTICLE IN BIBLIOGRAPHICA VOL. II. P. .CHAPTER XIIIODDS AND ENDSODDS AND ENDS THE COMPILER OF A VOLUME OF THIS SORT IS SURE TO FINDPLENTY OF THESESCRAPS WORTH PUTTING IN SOMEWHERE YET NOT COMINGPRECISELY UNDER ANY PARTICULAR HEAD. IN THE FIRST PLACE PORTRAITBOOKPLATES CLAIM ATTENTION. WE HAVE SEEN THAT THEY EXIST BUT ALASTHAT THEY ARE SO FEW FOR TO ANY REASONABLE PERSON MEMBERS OF THEHERALDS COLLEGE OF COURSE EXCEPTED A MANS FEATURES ARE CERTAINLYMORE INTERESTING THAN HIS ARMORIAL BEARINGS. IN ENGLAND SAM. PEPYSADOPTED THE STYLE WHICH WAS NOT THEN UNKNOWN ON THE CONTINENT.PIRCKHEIMER PERHAPS ORIGINATED IT BY PLACING AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID APORTRAIT OF HIMSELF AT THE END OF THE VOLUMES WHICH CONTAINED HIS NOWFAMILIAR BOOKPLATE BY DRER ON THE FRONT COVER AND THERE ARE MANYOTHER EARLY FOREIGN EXAMPLES. ONE OF THE MOST CONSPICUOUS IS THEBUSTPORTRAIT OF JOHN VENNITZER OF NUREMBERG ENGRAVED BY PFANN ANDDATED IN  TO WHICH I HAVE ALREADY ALLUDED P. . PEPYS USED TOPLACE THE SMALL VARIETY OF HIS PORTRAIT BOOKPLATETHAT FIGUREDOPPOSITEAT THE COMMENCEMENT OF MANY OF HIS BOOKS AND THAT SHOWING HISINTERWOVEN INITIALS THE LITTLE PLATE FOR MY BOOKS AT THE END. BOTHHIS PORTRAIT BOOKPLATES ARE BY WHITE. I HAVE FAILED TO FIND ANYALLUSION IN HIS DIARY TO THE ENGRAVING OF THESE BOOKPLATES THOUGHAS WE HAVE SEEN HE REFERS TO THE PREPARATION OF ANOTHER SEE P. . HEVERY LIKELY TOOK THE IDEA OF A PORTRAIT BOOKPLATE FROM THAT WHICHFAITHORNE EITHER IN OR SOON AFTER  PREPARED TO PLACE IN THEVOLUMES LEFT BY GOOD BISHOP HACKET TO CAMBRIDGE SEE P. .ILLUSTRATIONIT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE HAVE A PORTRAIT IN THE FIGURE ON THE BOOKPLATEALREADY NOTICED OF LOUIS BOSCH A CLERGYMAN OF TAMISE NEAR ANTWERPBUT THE HEAD IS TOO SMALL TO AFFORD AN INTERESTING LIKENESS. THE PRIESTSITS AT A TABLE IN HIS STUDY THE WALLS OF WHICH ARE LINED WITH VOLUMESAND BENEATH HIM IS WRITTEN IN LATIN A HUNT IN SUCH A FOREST NEVERWEARIESTHE FOREST BEING AS LORD DE TABLEY OBSERVES THE ROWS ANDRANKS OF HIS REVERENCES BOOKS. IN FRANCE THE PORTRAIT BOOKPLATE ISNOT UNCOMMON THAT OF A FRENCH CLERGYMAN FRANCIS PERRAULT FIGUREDOPPOSITE IS A NICE PIECE OF WORK AND BEARS THE DATE  BUTPORTRAITS POSSIBLY OR INDEED PROBABLY OF THE OWNERS OCCUR ON FRENCHBOOKPLATES AT AN EARLIER DATE. IN ITALY THERE IS AN EXAMPLE IN THE BOOKPLATE OF FILIPPO LINARTI.ILLUSTRATIONAN INSTANCE OF THE USE OF THE PORTRAIT BOOKPLATE IN ENGLAND DURINGTHE LAST CENTURY IS AFFORDED BY THAT OF JACOBUS GIBBS ARCHITECTUS WHICH IS FOUND IN THE ARCHITECTURAL BOOKS BEQUEATHED BY THEPOSSESSOR TO THE RADCLIFFE LIBRARY AT OXFORD A BUILDING WHICH HEDESIGNED. JAMES GIBBS WAS BORN AT ABERDEEN IN  BUT CAME SOUTH EARLYIN HIS CAREER AND LONDONERS MAY SEE EXAMPLES OF HIS WORK IN THECHURCHES OF ST. MARTININTHEFIELDS AND ST. MARY LE STRAND. HE ALSOBUILT THE SENATE HOUSE AT CAMBRIDGE. HE DIED IN . ON HIS BOOKPLATEWHICH IS OBLONG IN SHAPE AND MIGHT WELL FORM THE HEADPIECE TO APREFACE THE PORTRAIT APPEARS IN A MEDALLION SURROUNDED BY SHELL ANDSCROLLWORK. THE ENGRAVER WHO SIGNS HIS INITIALS B. B. WAS BERNARDBARON A FRENCHMAN WHO CAME TO ENGLAND IN  AND ENGRAVED HOGARTHSPORTRAIT OF GIBBS.THE RESUSCITATOR OF PORTRAIT BOOKPLATES IN ENGLAND IN RECENT TIMESWAS THE LATE MR. THOMS. THAT VETERAN ANTIQUARY TELLS IN A LETTER TO THEATHENUM HOW HE CAME TO USE AS A BOOKPLATE A PHOTOGRAPH OF HIMSELFTAKEN BY DR. DIAMOND IN THE VERY EARLY DAYS OF PHOTOGRAPHY. BENEATH THISHE PLACED AN INSCRIPTION SETTING FORTH THAT THE VOLUME IN WHICH IT WASFASTENED WAS FOR THE USE OF HIMSELF AND HIS FRIENDSA REPETITION OF THESENTIMENT ON ONE OF THE PIRCKHEIMER BOOKPLATES SIBI ET AMICIS. WE DONOT OF COURSE KNOW HOW FAR PIRCKHEIMER MEANT WHAT HE SAID BUT WE DOKNOW ANY OF US WHO EVER ASKED THE LOAN OF A VOLUME FROM MR. THOMS THATTHE SENTIMENT WAS BY HIM REALLY MEANT. NO WORTHY BOOKBORROWER EVER METWITH REFUSAL FROM THAT EVER COURTEOUS LITERARY ENTHUSIAST.AFTER CONSIDERING PORTRAIT BOOKPLATES THE COLLECTOR MAY TURN HISATTENTION TO THE STUDY OF THE BOOKPLATES THAT HAVE BELONGED TOINTERESTING MEN. I HAVE SPOKEN OF MANY OF THESE IN REACHING THIS POINTIN MY VOLUME BUT TO THE NAMES ALREADY MENTIONED MAY BE ADDED SOME MORECHARLES EARL OF DORSET AND MIDDLESEX WHO AS LORD BUCKHURST WAS APROMINENT FIGURE AT THE DULL COURT OF DUTCH WILLIAM SAVED DRYDEN FROMRUIN AND INTRODUCED MAT PRIOR TO SOCIETY. THEN THERE IS ROBERTHARLEYGREAT MINISTER GREAT STATESMAN AND UNDERMINER OF THE WHIGPOWER FOUNDER OF THE COLLECTION OF BOOKS AND MANUSCRIPTS WHICH NOWBEARS HIS NAME. THE INSCRIPTION ON HIS BOOKPLATE READS ROBERT HARLEYOF BRAMPTON CASTLE IN THE COUNTY OF HEREFORD ESQRE IT IS FOUND INTWO SIZESONE FOR FOLIO VOLUMES AND ANOTHER FOR THOSE OF SMALLER SIZE.ITS DATE MAY BE FIXED AT THE VERY CLOSE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.THEN WE HAVE THE BOOKPLATE OF SIR THOMAS HANMER THE SPEAKER A BOLDPIECE OF WORK IN THE SIMPLE ARMORIAL STYLE DATED . HANMER WASBORN IN  SO THAT HIS BOOKPLATE WAS EXECUTED WHEN HE WAS IN HISTHIRTYFIRST YEARTHAT IS SIX YEARS PRIOR TO HIS FIRST ENTRY OF THEHOUSE OF COMMONS AND PROBABLY BEFORE HE HAD MADE MUCH USE OF THELIBRARY WITH WHICH HIS NAME WAS AFTERWARDS ASSOCIATED WHEN TOWARDS THECLOSE OF HIS LIFE HE CEASED TO BE A MAN OF POLITICS AND BECAME A MAN OFLETTERS. HE DIED IN  LEAVING COMPLETED HIS EDITION OFSHAKESPEARES WORKS IN HALF A DOZEN VOLUMES.WITH THE BOOKPLATE OF SIR THOMAS HANMER WE MAY APPROPRIATELYCONSIDER THAT OF SIR PAUL METHUEN THE SOLDIER AND MINISTER OF ANNE ANDGEORGE I. WITH WHOM HANMER MUST HAVE BEEN FREQUENTLY BROUGHT INCONTACT. METHUENS BOOKPLATE IS ALTOGETHER MORE EXCEPTIONAL IN STYLETHAN HANMERS THE MANTLING AFTER BEING BLOWN ABOUT BY A STRONG WINDENDS REGULARLY IN TASSELS CURIOUS CREATURES FIGURE IN THE DESIGN ANDTHE BRACKET ON WHICH RESTS THE SHIELD IS UPHELD BY A MALE AND A FEMALEANGEL.METHUENS BOOKPLATE WAS ENGRAVED ABOUT . FIVE YEARS LATER WE FINDTHAT OF JOHN LORD BOYLE WHO THOUGH BY MEANS OF THE QUARREL WITH HISFATHER HE WAS ROBBED OF THE BOYLE LIBRARY HAD WHILST YET A YOUNG MANA SUFFICIENT STOCK OF VOLUMES OF HIS OWN TO NECESSITATE THE USE OF ADISTINGUISHING MARK FOR THEM. HIS BOOKPLATE IS BY JOHN HULETT ANINDIFFERENT ENGRAVER.MATTHEW PRIORS BOOKPLATE NOW CLAIMS ATTENTION INDEED IF THESEBOOKPLATES OF CELEBRITIES WERE TAKEN IN STRICTLY CHRONOLOGICAL ORDERIT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED BEFORE THAT OF SIR PAUL METHUEN. IN STYLEIT IS EARLY JACOBEAN SO THAT WE MAY DATE IT AT SAY  THOUGH THEREIS NOTHING IN THE INSCRIPTIONMATTHEW PRIOR ESQ.TO SHOW TO WHATPARTICULAR PERIOD IN THE THIN HOLLOWLOOKED MANS LIFE IT BELONGS. BUTIT IS TEMPTING TO PLACE IT AT THE CLOSE OF HIS CAREER AS A DIPLOMATISTWHEN HE WAS SETTLING DOWN ON THE SMALL COUNTRY PROPERTY THAT HARLEY HADBOUGHT FOR HIM AND WAS RICH ON THE PROCEEDS OF THE SUBSCRIPTION TO HISHUGE VOLUME OF OCCASIONAL POEMS.AFTER PRIORS BOOKPLATE WE DO NOT MEET WITH ANOTHER OF A CELEBRITY FORA CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF YEARS. ONE APPEARS AT LAST IN THATENGRAVEDPROBABLY BY A SCOTCH ENGRAVER ABOUT THE YEAR FOR THELUCKLESS LORD LOVAT WHO LOST HIS HEAD ON TOWER HILL AFTER THE SECONDSCOTCH REBELLION. THE INSCRIPTION DESERVES CONSIDERATION BECAUSE IT ISCHARACTERISTIC OF THE MAN THE RIGHT HONOURABLE SIMON LORD FRASER OFLOVAT CHIEF OF THE ANCIENT CLAN OF THE FRASERS GOVERNOR OF INVERNESSETC. MARK THE WAY IN WHICH HE EMPHASISES HIS HEADSHIP OF THE CLAN CANHE IN THOSE EARLY DAYS HAVE HEARD WHISPERINGS OF A STORY THAT HE HADAN ELDER BROTHER WHO WAS IN HIDING LEST THE LAW SHOULD METE OUT TO HIMITS PENALTY FOR MURDER ANYHOW IT IS A FINE BOLD BOOKPLATE MORE INTHE STYLE OF ENGLISH BOOKPLATES OF A DOZEN YEARS EARLIER A HEAVYERMINELINED MANTLE OF ESTATE FALLS FROM THE BACK OF THE HELMET ANDENCLOSES BOTH SHIELD AND SUPPORTERS.JOHN WILKES HAD THREE BOOKPLATES AND WHAT IS REMARKABLE THEY ALL MAKEDISPLAY OF THE WILKES ARMORIAL BEARINGS. ONE WOULD FANCY THAT THE GREATDEMAGOGUE WOULD AT LEAST IN THE DECORATION OF THE SHIELD DISPLAYBOMBS KEGS OF GUNPOWDER PHRYGIAN CAPS OR OTHER EMBLEMS OF THEMANIFESTATION AND ENJOYMENT OF LIBERTY BUT IT IS NOT SO. LAWRENCESTERNES BOOKPLATE IS CERTAINLY MORE APPROPRIATE. HERE WE HAVE THE BUSTOF A YOUNG MAN WHOM LORD DE TABLEY CONSIDERS TO BE EITHER JUVENAL ORMARTIAL PLACED ON A SLAB ON EITHER SIDE OF WHICH ARE CLOSED VOLUMESONE INSCRIBED ALAS POOR YORICK AND THE OTHER TRISTRAM SHANDY.

SAMUEL ROGERSS BOOKPLATE IS IN THE WREATH ANDRIBBON STYLE. WILLIAM COWPERS IS A LITTLE LATER AND SHOWS US A PLAINSHIELD WITHOUT THE FESTOONDECORATION. HIS MUST BECOME A SCARCEBOOKPLATE FOR HE HAD BUT FEW BOOKSONLY  AT HIS DEATH AND THEBOOKPLATE DOES NOT APPEAR IN ALL PERHAPS HE BEGAN TO INSERT IT BUTWAS STOPPED BY LOSS OF REASON. MR.

BYRONS BOOKPLATE ALLUDEDTO ELSEWHERE IS WITHOUT ONE REMARKABLE FEATURE WHETHER OR NOT IT ISTHAT SENT HIM BY THE FAIR ADMIRER ALREADY REFERRED TO P.  ONE CANNOTSAY. THOMAS CARLYLES BOOKPLATE WAS ENGRAVED IN  BY H. P. WALKER.ONE MIGHT EXTEND A LIST OF CELEBRITIES WHO HAVE USED BOOKPLATES ADINFINITUM BUT THERE IS NO NEED TO ATTEMPT THAT PROCESS HERE THOUGH ITMIGHT BE AS WELL TO POINT OUT THAT CERTAIN BOOKPLATES INSCRIBED WITHTHE NAMES OF CELEBRITIES WHICH HAVE INDUCED COLLECTORS TO SPEAK OFTHEM AS THE BOOKPLATES OF THESE DISTINGUISHED PERSONS CANNOT REALLYHAVE BEEN MADE FOR THEM. THERE IS FOR INSTANCE AN EARLY CHIPPENDALEBOOKPLATE INSCRIBED WILLIAM WILBERFORCE WHICH IS OR PERHAPS ISHOULD SAY USED TO BE CONSTANTLY SPOKEN OF AS THE BOOKPLATE OF THEFAMOUS MAN WHO WAS BOLD ENOUGH TO SUGGEST THAT ENGLANDS COLONIES COULDGET ON VERY WELL WITHOUT THE PRESENCE OF SLAVERY. NOW THIS BOOKPLATE ISVERY LITTLE IF ANY LATER THAN  AND THE GREAT EMANCIPATOR WAS NOTBORN TILL  AS A MATTER OF FACT IT WAS PROBABLY ENGRAVED FOR HISGRANDFATHER WILLIAM WILBERFORCE OF HULL. A GREAT MANY SPECIMENS BEARHIS SIGNATURE WRITTEN AT THE TOP OF THE BOOKPLATE. THEN TO GIVE ONEMORE INSTANCE THERE IS THE BOOKPLATE INSCRIBED CAPT. COOK AND INTHIS YOU ARE TOLD TO SEE THE MARK OF OWNERSHIP WHICH THE ONCE POPULARHERO PLACED IN THE VOLUMES THAT COMPOSED HIS LIBRARY BUT SO FAR AS THEEVIDENCE OF THIS BOOKPLATE GOES CAPTAIN COOK MAY NEVER HAVE HAD ALIBRARY AT ALL. IT BEARS ARMS HIGHLY APPROPRIATE TO A NAVIGATOR BUTTHEY WERE NOT GRANTED TO THE COOK FAMILY TILL  AND AS EVERY READEROF TRAVEL KNOWS CAPTAIN COOK WAS MURDERED IN . IN ALL PROBABILITYTHIS BOOKPLATE WAS ENGRAVED FOR THE NAVIGATORS SON JAMES COOK WHOIN  ATTAINED TO THE RANK OF COMMANDER IN THE NAVY  BE ITSAID ISTO JUDGE FROM ITS STYLE AND DECORATIONABOUT THE DATE OF THEBOOKPLATE.BOOKPLATES OF ENGLISH PARISH LIBRARIES AND INSTITUTIONS DESERVE SOMENOTICE FOR SEVERAL REASONS. IN THESE DAYS WHEN ENTHUSIASM FOR THEERECTION OF FREE LIBRARIES IS SO GREAT IT IS CURIOUS TO BE REMINDED OFTHE PAST AND LONGFORGOTTEN EFFORTS OF OUR ANCESTORS TO CIVILISE THEIRNEIGHBOURS BY THE USE OF BOOKS. GLOOMY AFFAIRS MOST OF THESE PARISHLIBRARIES ARE NOW YOU STILL SOMETIMES FIND THEM LOCKED IN A DAMPVESTRY OR IN A COUNTRY VICARAGE WHERE THEIR EXISTENCE IS A SECRET TOTHE PARISHIONERS AND INDEED TO MOST OTHER PEOPLE. THE BOOKPLATES OFSOME OF THEM ARE INTERESTING. THERE IS A NEAT DESIGN IN THE JACOBEANSTYLE WHICH SHOWS US THE SHIELD DIVIDED AND CONTAINS ON THE SINISTERSIDE TWO CROSSED KEYS AND ON THE DEXTER TWO CROSSED SWORDS. THIS ISINSCRIBED SWAFFHAM LIBRARY. T. DALTON F. RAYNER CHURCHWARDENS .AT LEAST TWO DESIGNS FOR THESE PARISH BOOKPLATES ARE BY SIMON GRIBELIN.IN ONE WE HAVE ST. JOHN IN THE ISLE OF PATMOS AND IN THE OTHER ANUNIDENTIFIABLE FIGURE KNEELING IN PRAYER. TO EACH THE ARTIST HAS PLACEDHIS INITIALS S. G. AND BOTH BELONG TO ABOUT THE SAME DATE.A GREAT MANY OF THESE PAROCHIAL LIBRARIES WERE FOUNDED EARLY IN THE LASTCENTURY BY DR. THOMAS BRAY DURING HIS LIFETIME AND BY A BODY CALLINGTHEMSELVES THE ASSOCIATES OF DR. BRAY AFTER HIS DEATH. IT WAS ATBRAYS INSTANCE THAT THE ACT OF  ANNE FOR THE BETTER PRESERVATION OFPAROCHIAL LIBRARIES WAS PASSED BY PARLIAMENT. ONE OF THE EARLIEST OFTHE FOUNDATIONS UNDER IT WAS IN .IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE ASSOCIATES ISSUED BOOKPLATES FOR PLACING INTHE VOLUMES OF THE DIFFERENT LIBRARIES ESTABLISHED FOR THERE IS INTHE DESIGN A SPACE LEFT BLANK FOR THE INSERTION WITH PEN AND INK OFTHE NAME OF THE PARTICULAR LIBRARY USING THE BOOKPLATE. THESEBOOKPLATES GENERALLY BEAR TEXTS OR SOME APPROPRIATE WORDS SUCH ASACCIPE LIBRUM ET DEVORA ILLUM REV. X.  THE SCENE DEPICTED BEINGST. JOHN IN THE ISLE OF PATMOS RECEIVING THE BOOK FROM THE ANGEL ORSOMETIMES A REMINDER TO THE BORROWER THAT HE NEEDS TO DO MORE THANBORROW THE VOLUME IN ORDER TO PROFIT BY ITS CONTENTS SUCH AS TOLLELEGE WHICH APPEARS ON THE BOOKPLATE OF THE PARISH LIBRARY OF WEOBLEYGROTESQUE HERALDRY IS NOT OFTEN MET WITH IN ENGLAND ON GENUINEBOOKPLATES. WE HAVE SEEN THAT ON MANY EXAMPLES THE DECORATIVEACCESSORIES OF THE SHIELD HAVE A CERTAIN APPROPRIATENESS TO THE OWNERBESIDES THIS THE ARMS BORNE HAVE FREQUENTLY A DIRECT REFERENCE TO THEBEARERS NAME. BUT GROTESQUE HERALDRY SUCH AS THAT WHICH HOGARTH WAS SOFOND OF DESIGNING IS CERTAINLY RARE IN ENGRAVINGS PREPARED FORBOOKPLATES. THERE IS HOWEVER ONE EXAMPLE OF SUCH HERALDRY ON ANENGLISH BOOKPLATE WHICH IS WORTH REFERRING TOI MEAN THE VERYINTERESTING EXAMPLE FIGURED ON P. . THIS BELONGED TO THESHOEMAKERPOET ROBERT BLOOMFIELD AND CERTAINLY THE ARMS UPON IT AREBOTH GROTESQUE AND APPROPRIATE TO THE OWNER SINCE THEY COMMEMORATE HISONLY REALLY SUCCESSFUL LITERARY EFFORT THE FARMERS BOY. LOOK FOR AMOMENT AT THE DETAILS FOR THEY REPAY INSPECTION. A FIGURE ON COWBACKHOLDING A SHOE ON THE END OF A STICK DOES DUTY AS A CREST TWOPLOUGHMEN ACT AS SUPPORTERS WHILST THE BEARINGS ON THE SHIELD REPRESENTEVERY VARIETY OF AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT EVERY OCCUPANT OF A FARMYARDORDINARILY MET WITH AND VARIOUS TOOLS CONNECTED WITH THE OWNERS CRAFTBESIDES ON THE SINISTER HALF OF THE SHIELD IS A COBBLER IN AN ATTITUDESUGGESTIVE OF HIS HAVING DONE FULL JUSTICE TO A FEAST IN HONOUR OF ST.CRISPINNOT CONDUCTED ON TOTAL ABSTINENCE PRINCIPLES. THE QUARTERINGSALSO INCLUDE THREE OPEN VOLUMES AND ACROSS THE PAGES OF ONE IS PRINTEDFARMERS BOY. THE WHOLEEVEN TO ITS MOTTO A FIG FOR THEHERALDSIS MOST CHARACTERISTIC OF BLOOMFIELD AND WAS ENGRAVED FORHIM IN TEN YEARS BEFORE HIS DEATHBY A CHEAPSIDE ENGRAVER.ILLUSTRATION                                   WITH THIS GATHERING TOGETHER OF SCRAPS AND CLIPPINGS I WILL BRING MYVOLUME TO A CLOSE. MOST OF WHAT I HAVE SAID AND A VERY GREAT DEALBESIDES IS WELL KNOWN TO THE STUDENTS OF BOOKPLATES BUT TO THEM IFANCY THIS WORK IS NOT INTENDED TO APPEAL. IT IS MEANT FOR THE PUBLICAT LARGE TO THE MAJORITY OF WHOM BOOKPLATES ARE UNCONSIDERED TRIFLES.TO PROMOTE WHOLESALE BOOKPLATE COLLECTING IN ALBUMS AND PORTFOLIOS ISCERTAINLY NOT MY INTENTION. IF IT WERE IT WOULD BE A VERY UNDESIRABLEINTENTION FOR SO FAR AS IT SUCCEEDED IT WOULD UNQUESTIONABLY LEAD TOTHE WHOLESALE DISFIGUREMENT AND DESTRUCTION OF BOOKS WITHOUT REGARD TOTHEIR VALUE. WHAT I HAVE AIMED AT IS TO AWAKEN A WIDER INTEREST INBOOKPLATES AND A WIDER OBSERVATION OF THEM IN THEIR ABIDING PLACES BYTHOSE WHO EITHER POSSESS THEM ALREADY OR ACQUIRE THEM HEREAFTER. IF IHAVE SUCCEEDED IN DOING THIS MY WORK WILL I AM VAIN ENOUGH TO BELIEVEBE NOT ALTOGETHER UNSUCCESSFUL FOR BOOKPLATES POSSESS REALLY ANARTISTIC AND GENERAL INTEREST WHICH WILL BE HEIGHTENED THE MORE OURSTOCK OF KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING THEM IS INCREASED.INDEX  ACLAND FRANCES ANNE .
